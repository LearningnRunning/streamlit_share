Wasn't what I expected.
Really enjoyed it.
Including the hope for redemption at the end.
A true feel good movie that I wish I saw in theaters.
Anne Hathaway and Robert DeNiro have great chemistry and the movie tells a great story of 2 people generations apart growing closer and learning from each other.
There is strong character development and a solid cast all around.
I recommend it to anyone.
All the pieces seem to be there except a truly appropriate third act.
The intern' has chemistry-rich lead performances and a tenured auteur behind the camera.
Brilliant movie!
"So warm, so satisfying and so moved!"
Recommend
These two bonified great actors somehow have a great chemistry that truly makes this movie worth watching.
It rushes the story along but that doesn't take away from the heartwarming affect it was going for.
The movie was very good!
I can't believe what other critics are rating and saying about this movie.
2 legendary actors with a good script.
"Good film overall, loved Robert de Niro, who fit the role really well."
The story was pretty standard stuff however fun to watch and something to take away.
Very entertaining movie for when you just want to have a good time.
I really enjoyed a lot of this.
"Thought De Niro really nailed his part, he was at the top of his game."
Well worth a watch; although I wished a couple of the endings went a different way.
A gentle film with low stakes and surface level lessons/values.
"Beautifully shot and well acted, but the story lacks depth."
De Niro and Hathaway's mad acting skills manage to raise an otherwise boring film to very nearly interesting.
"Odd, that in all of Hathaway's meetings, she never one considered hiring a female CEO?"
"Sadly, the successful entrepreneur will continue burning themself out because they cannot let go and struggle to delegate unless a flawless person who always says the right things magically shows up."
"O filme at√© que √© bom, bastante divertido."
"Mas o final n√£o fez nenhum sentido, filme bem sess√£o da tarde mesmo."
"This movie was a good one to just throw on and enjoy, it's usually not my type of movie but I quite enjoyed the duo onscreen and the lessons you learn along the way."
"If you're looking for a feel-good film, this is it."
A fantastic cast and a compelling story.
We all know what it is to spread ourselves too thin and feel like an outsider.
Learn something about work-life balance and how to fit in by being yourself.
I came across this movie because I was looking for a wholesome movie that would make me regain some sort of faith in humanity.
"For the most part, this movie delivered."
"I'm not sure I agree with her decision in the end, but that was her decision I guess."
"Idk, the first half was very wholesome...but it got messy towards the end."
But I guess that's life...messy.
This is a terrible movie with an awful message.
The only pro I give is the feminism behind showing that women can be on top but it is done in the most disgraceful way.
"Hathaway's character is out is control, clearly not able to handle a growing company, completely oblivious of tech (like not using email recall), and sinking it even more out of her power trip of not having a boss."
A lot of shaming the new generation of men and glorifying the boomers.
Extremely capitalist and pro destroying everything around you for your job.
"WTF with going to bars with employees (which you don't know their name because you are too ""powerful"") instead of going home and spend time with your family."
The idea of feminism is to become better collectively and not for women to start acting like the stereotypical men.
"Also, sexual harrassment is out there like a joke...really?"
Is it ok because it is done to a guy?
"Special Effects: 1,0/Sound Effects: 1,0/Acting: 1,0/Story: 2,0"
"Just a classic, pulls at all the good heartstrings, the best duo!"
"It's so well written, the characters are all adorable."
"It's funny and sad, suspenseful and action packed."
What could be better?
Like it.
I bit long but good story
Why whyyy is this movie not rated above 90%?
.
It's one it's kind.
"So fresh, warm, cozy and positive."
It somehow teaches way of living.
"I always go hopeful, happy, and content after watching this movie."
A definitely must watch!!
!
"Very beautiful, well written movie!"
Hats off to the creator ‚ù§Ô∏èü•≥
The tell phone rings in the background....heart thought it was my stalking Baby mama...had to quit immediatly
"it makes me feel warm and cozy in my chest , a very nostalgic feeling"
This movie is one of the sweetest you'll ever watch!
It has both the comedy and drama as well as a really sweet story.
Overall it's an Awsome movie!
"If you want to simply smile for 2 hours straight, go ahead and watch this movie."
I have zero clue why anyone would rated this under 5 stars for a comedy/drama.
The chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway is tremendous.
I bought the whole thing and somehow there's actually a decent premise and storyline.
Simple but sweet!
"I'd been having a terrible week where everything has gone wrong, and this movie was on TV in my hotel room and helped to distract me for a bit."
"I found myself smiling at some parts, and it was overall just a nice movie"
"Deniro and Hathaway have good chemistry here, but the overall emotional tone is too mushy for me; feels manipulative."
Deniro's character is too good to be true.
Because he's Deniro he can almost get away with it.
The messages about social and gender roles seem overly simplified and sort of muddy at the same time.
"Worth the attempt, but didn't quite pull it off"
Serviceable.
Has a low-key feel to it.
Something about it though brought me back to watch it again.
So there is something to it... although i don't think it ever really hit the mark it was aiming for.
"Cute movie, it's a nice 2 hours well spent if you have nothing better to do."
Solid flick.
Worth a watch.
Def Fresh
"If you don‚Äôt vibe with the charm Nancy Meyers brings, just move on."
Very boring.
Seemed film was more interested in creating a statement than making it an enjoyable film.
This movie makes people emotional and reminds us of why senior people are still very important in our society.
Robert de niro makes such an amazing character that actually makes me feel calm to.
"Anne Hathway also makes an awsome character, power woman and rmaking a refrence to working moms which is a social issue today."
The plot is good.
It's a movie that makes you smile and laught a little.
"What a movie it was, i don't know why this movie has low rating but believe me this is masterpiece, mood changerü•∞"
esta pelicula da una buena vibra con la quimica de sus talentos protagonistas
This movie is old but GOLD!
Nancy Meyer's take on this movie is a breath of air.
Anne Hathaway and Robert DeNiro played their characters very well that made the movie more interesting to watch.
"I love this movie, the mix of old and modern references is amazing!"
This movie is for those that don‚Äôt take life to seriously and are just laid back.
My therapist metros like film it's too dark knight esque.
"Will be one of the all time classics, as good as ""its a wonderful life"" and others."
"What the film does, is instil those good old values and attributes in a modern digital world, mixed into the emotions of old school gentleman."
A golden future classic.
"Great movie, it shows different story in one movie"
Undemanding.
Pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.
This movie was so wholesome and amazing üëè there were times I almost cried üò¢ and alot times it made me smile
I had chosen this movie because I am great Anne Hathaway fan.
So obviously I was sure the movie was to be great.
"But when I watched it, I found the movie to be a fresh watch, something so subtle but touching with glimpses of laughs."
The thing which touched the most was the story and the performances of Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway.
Specially that moment when they both work late night and he says he used to work at the same spot years ago.
Must watch movie!
This is a good movie.
The story is good the music is beautiful.
Robert de Niro plays a wonderful character.
To watch
Less about what is said .
more about how it is said.
Simple story where the ending is apparent from the outset.
"The point is, with this film, in watching the plot unfold."
Nothing deep.
Nothing urging you to set a date to watch it again.
"Rather, more something about how people can feel."
Interactions.
We all know about what it takes to put a winning production together.
Good writing.
Good acting .
and all the rest.
"This is no Gone With the Wind, it's just a show about ."
about people.
Nothing more.
And you wind up with a pleased smile.
Pick your own person to identify with.
"I'm older, so DeNiro is for me."
Taught me the value of keeping my mouth shut more often.
Pays off.
Perfect three stars.
I liked this movie from start to finish.
"Loved the relationship between the intern and Jules, it made me think of a very proud granddad who tries to help his niece out."
2 very well spent hours.
Enjoyed DeNiro for the first time in awhile.
Loved the burglary sequence.
"Robert De Niro in a comedy movie, a very decent movie."
Did enjoy it.
7.5/10
Very lame movie and the acting was forced in most scenes.
Not recommended
"A feel-good dramedy which, although drawn out in places, has its moments and is bound to make you smile."
I'm surprised the critics gave this one such poor ratings.
Makes me wonder if they ever know how to enjoy a good movie.
"So, it's not original, so it raises a few issues that we may not agree on or whatever but this movie made me laugh, then cry, and in the end, it left me with a feeling of warmth."
I enjoyed this so much.
I used to watch movies based on critic's ratings but now I know better.
A touching story with great actors.
Awesome.
"The script, the acting of the two leads, the story and how much you feel for the relationships, all very well done, except for Anders Holm acting."
If Jules' husband was played by some actor with better acting it'd have been stellar.
Anders really didn't make me connect with or feel for the husband at all.
His face was the same 99% of the time he's on screen.
"Anyhow still a well-executed, emotionally mature, well-written movie to watch."
Kudos to Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway.
"At the beginning, I felt good, but after a while all that cringe came in and ruined everything."
Not so feel good movie.
its good.
De Niro is so cool in that movie
"La pel√≠cula trata horrible los problemas de una pareja al acordar sus propias metas, la historia es mal√≠sima pero Robert De Niro y Anne Hathaway no la vuelven aburrida."
Really enjoy watching the movie.
Love the performance of Anne and Robert
Why all the great reviews.
Worst movie I've seen mr De Niro in.
Movie is to reflect a work place that never in a thousand years would exist.
Or am I just narrow minded.
"Whatever, terrible."
"This movie is just such a feel-good movie, I always end up so happy after watching it."
"Robert De Niro ha trovato ormai casa in queste commedie in cui pu√≤ esprimere un lato pi√π divertente di s√®, a lungo sovrastato da grandi performance drammatiche."
"""The Intern"" √® un film piacevole, originale e con davvero pochi difetti; lo si guarda con piacere dall'inizio alla fine."
"Magari, sarebbe stato interessante, completare la sceneggiatura con qualche personaggio di contorno pi√π interessante, a tratti si sente un po' la mancanza."
Both the stars acting compliments each other.
A very enjoyable movie
This movie is really healing me!
I could see the importance of occupation at life.
"Do work because it makes me think of myself with pride and self-esteem, rather to obsess over money!"
A good hearted drama comedy that entertains without becoming overly sentimental.
It's a relaxing watch.
Robert De Niro jako alfa i omega
this is my favorite movie ever ... WATCH IT!
:)
"One of Nancy Meyers' absolute humane best with the usual charm-turned sweetness into something unexpectedly wholesomely heartening, benefitting from the finely casted chemistries that were enough to make this hilarious, insightful comedy one of the best feel-good films in recent memory."
(A-)
Not even the inmense acting chops of Deniro and Hathaway could save this film from the lack of focus and story.
"this isnt a bad movie, its just not interesting or memorable."
its bland.
It's so fun to watch from beginning til the end.
"I've always been a fan of stories about building friendships between young and old people, particularly in their exchange of wisdom which involves respect, mutual admiration, and compassion."
It's a feel good story.
Great movie very wholesome to watch.
"The two stars are fantastic and well matched, but Hathaway's character get a terrible sexist arch that seems to defend men cheating on women if they are too impowered."
"""Mark Zuckerberg never brought in a CEO - and he was a teenager!"""
"The movie is about love, life, lessons, falls, and getups."
Surprisingly touching and happy.
"It puts life, feminism, work, marriage, kids on the table and discusses it."
Life lessons are demonstrated naturally and not in a boring way.
De Niro still a great actor.
"Now older, he is doing more dramatic movies and the man still on fire."
Some facial expressions are his and no one else could ever do it.
The chemistry he got with Hathaway is touching and happy.
It's almost as they are connected with each other and with you and me.
And what about Hathaway?
"She is gorgeous, frenetic, and as expressive as De Niro."
They could do those scenes without even talk.
"""The Intern"" has a slow and tiring narrative, the script barely moves and the ending is disappointing"
This movie is very sweet and does a fantastic job of building the relationship between the 2 main characters
This is a really good movie.
It is not the kind of movie I like seeing De Niro in but I have to admit him and Hathaway are very good together in this movie.
"Its story is quite clich√©, but it is redeemed thanks to its modern approach and the chemistry of its leads."
I love this movie.
I've seen this several times.
It's a feel-good film.
I think the whole world should have a Senior Intern because it helps them to adapt with the new norms.
It also make them feel that they belong or they are still part of something....a community.
I love Anne Hathaway.
I think she's a great actress.
The relationship of Jules (Hathaway) and Ben (De Niro) is very admirable.
He's like a father to her more than a colleague.
What I didn't like though was when Matt (Jules' husband) had an affair and made Jules feel that it was her fault because her company became successful in less than two years.
"However, the ending was great."
Everything just fell into place.
So this is what Anne Hathaway did after she left 'The Runway' in 'Devil Wears Prada'.
Are we in some sort of Anne Hathaway and fashion cinematic universe perhaps?
"Even if we are, I would not mind it."
"Jokes aside, 'The Intern' is truly a heartfelt, cheerful and emotionally uplifting film powered by beautiful and nuanced performances by Rober De Niro and Anne Hathaway."
Some subplots can feel irrelevant to the final story and feel crammed in to fit the runtime.
"By no means, the film gets boring but you feel that there is not much substance here."
"The film looks good though, the cinematography is fantastic."
The dialogues are quirky and witty.
The chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway is what lifts this film from average to good!
Recommended!
The best thing I can say about the Intern is that it doesn't suck.
It draws you in so well you want it to be good.
Then it punches you in the gut and you never recover.
It ends with you feeling like the writer got to the 1 yard line and then he dropped the ball.
"Great run, no touchdown."
I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked this movie; a retired businessman and widower (De Niro) decides to apply as an intern for a successful online fashion start-up company founded by ambitious Jules Ostin (Ann Hathaway) -- they are generations apart but they find a way to successfully work and support each other.
"Along the way, both are able to find friendship and reliable people they can count on."
Highly recommended!
"It has an intriguing premise, but doesn't evolve too much commentaires aside from the clich√©d situations."
"Still, it is charming movie and a good watch and really works because of the chemistry of Anne Hathaway (doing her best) and Robert De Niro (truly a standout)."
Commedia pi√π che dignitosa che nasconde una morale pi√π profonda del previsto e del necessario.
Nella seconda met√† del film si sbarca in territori pericolosi proponendo un'idea di fondo forzata con risvolti narrativi inconsistenti.
"La buona sintonia tra la coppia dei protagonisti rende comunque il film assolutamente apprezzabile, un'esperienza leggera e passeggera."
This is one of those movies that just puts you in a happy mood.
"It's not classic cinema, but it also wasn't meant to be."
"The main success is the chemistry by the entire cast, particularly the two leads."
"I don't necessarily dislike this film, but it has way too many cheesy/cringey moments for me to enjoy it."
"Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway are good, though a lot of their meaningful scenes feel forced due to the writing and dialogue."
I would've let it slide if 'The Intern' wasn't on for two hours - that's too much cheese for me.
The story was beautifully portrayed by very powerful actors.
"Like a breath of fresh air...no violence, swearing, politics.....just considerate people."
De Niro was great helping everyone out with everything...but it was a 2-way street....all the young employees were very respectful to him too.
"Like George Martin said about Billy Preston's time with the Beatles.....he was like a 'lubricant' ...everyone loved him, all the band members were politer to each other and in better spirits...there was no pettyness...John wanted him in the band permanently.....when Preston left he was really missed."
"Really great chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway, subtle and intelligent dialogue."
"However, I think if the husband/wife roles had been reversed, viewers would not be so pleased with conclusion that 'homemaker"" should be totally behind ""breadwinner"" , shut up and mind the child."
‚ÄòThe Intern' is a MUST SEE.
"The film is not only heartwarming, but leaves you with a good feeling inside."
It is such a positive message that drives home what being a good person and a hard worker means.
One of my favorite movies of all time.
It was... okay?
It really liked playing with old people stereotypes but not in a bad way just in a ham-fisted way.
I don't really know what the movie was trying to teach me.
"What I got is, ""Woman can be good bosses but also should forgive cheaters."""
I cannot wipe the smile off my face while watching this.
"It's the ultimate feel-good movie, and it tackles issues in the most wholesome way possible."
Stellar acting from De Niro and Hathaway as well.
One of the best feel good movies of this generation and gives a nod to old school customs.
"I appreciated De Niro's gentlemanly, likable character and Hathaway's character development from micro to macro despite the horrendous husband debacle."
"Personally, could have done with out that part of the movie but critics already said this movie wasn't edgy enough..."
"I'll watch this again, to me that says it all..."
"The Intern suffers from lack of ideas, their development and history itself."
Everything unfolds in areas almost white phones of the golden age of Hollywood.
Neither of them has problems other than being workaholics.
"And when a problem arises, everything will be resolved sooner rather than later."
A nice movie to see with your family.
This movie made me laugh 0 times ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è basically this movie is if u wanna c Robert Deniro act like a reg.
guy.
"this movie cements my love for De Nero, a feel-good movie that started brilliantly introducing that scary side of a seventy-year-old widower's insufferable life, which changed a lot when he accidentally found a flyer about a senior internship program."
the movie is at its best when Ben is the focus.
"which doesn't happen too much thanks to Anne Hathaway's character and her uninteresting in-going relationship with her husband "" a bad actor by the way"""
Great cast and enjoyable story
"Entertaining, funny and sometimes touching plot."
Good acting throughout.
I find it hard to say anything negative about this film.
De Niro and Hathaway really worked well together.
"Both a funny and at times heart-warming film, De Niro proves his talents brilliantly in a more gentle, fatherly role."
"She‚Äôs cute, De Niro is pathetic and a terrible actor."
Save your money.
"A friend of mine who is also a movie lover described this movie in a few simples words "" Why did Robert De Niro do this movie?"
"Normally older actor accept projects they really like"""
Good story to tell; however it never explained why a man with all his experience couldn't take administrative chores off the boss.
Very entertaining.
It's refreshing to see DeNiro take on a role that doesn't tap into his best acting skills and still play a role perfectly.
in character.
I have seen this movie at least three times and always enjoy it every time.
Robert DeNiro's character brings a calm and focus to a very upended office environment.
"My favorite scene: in his closet, explaining why all men should carry handkerchiefs."
"Cute movie, would recommend."
Sentimental ending
The intern is funny and heartwarming.
It's a wonder De Niro went from this to the appalling Dirty Grandpa.
Actually pretty funny and heart warming
Such a sweet film!
"I laughed, I cried."
"Major feel good, original, best acting I've seen out of Anne Hathaway in several years."
Would highly recommend!
Its a feel good movie and i am sure that everyone is going to wish for an intern from nowüòâ
Lovely enjoyable film.
Hathaway and Deniro are great in this film.
"OK movie, De Nero sucked in this movie."
"Really liked this movie, the cast is great and the story full of surprises!"
The next genocidal uprising.
Hathaway is in great form in The Intern.
She really is believable as CEO Jules Ostin and really excels in the role.
Nancy Meyers really excels at these rom-com movies that make you feel like the characters are believable and the storyline (even no matter how absurd) might actually be believable.
"Aside from Hathaway, De Niro is a breath of fresh air as a 70-year-old widower who is just trying to figure out life as a retiree."
"The only negative that I could grasp from this movie is the fact that all the younger people took a page from De Niro's ""experience"" and started molding towards his way of life, but he never reciprocated that behavior."
I guess having him sign up for Facebook?
"As a Workaholics fan, I really enjoyed seeing Anders in a more serious role and he really performed it quite well."
Well until he had to cry that is.
Great chemistry from Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway.
Fun and funny.
A perfect choice for our datenight.
who wrote this garbage
It was a feel good movie was some heart and some laughs but nothing special.
"The movie earns one star for being outstandingly bland, to the point that it would be fair to call this the cinematic equivalent of a pack of white K-Mart dress shirts... watched using boxxy software yesterday."
"In one word, not bad."
"Great movie i loved every part of it , i loved the spontaneity in it , and i have to say Robert de niro and Anne Hathaway are the dynamic duo and i would kill to see them again , i would watch this masterpiece multiple time and still be happy every time."
Touching and heart felt.
Great performances by Hathaway and DeNiro.
SMART AND WITTY WHAT A GREAT MATCH!
"I get what others are saying about his acting, its tired and old, just like him!"
SAD he's got to stoop to this crap!
The Intern is like a stack of pancakes.
"It's warm, sweet and leaves you with a touch of a belly ache."
"You are, no doubt, drawn in by the casting and who could resist a movie that brings together Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway?"
"They're the best actors of their respective generations, but - WOW!"
- you keep wishing that they could find each other in a better movie.
"The Intern isn't bad exactly; it's light, breezy but is of no real significance."
"De Niro, who seems to have retired from the hard-boiled, challenging roles that made him famous, plays a good-hearted retired widower named Ben Whittaker."
"Retired from a now defunct company that made phone books, he now spends his days trying to figure out how to spend his days."
His wife of 42 years is dead and he needs a challenge.
"So, he answers an ad for an outreach program for senior interns (senior as in age) to help out at 'About to Fit', a successful internet company that specializes in women's clothing."
"Ben gets the unenviable task of being the intern to the company's CEO, a supposedly tough-as-nails career woman named Jules Ostin (Hathaway)."
"She claims she doesn't need him, but Romantic Comedy Law demands that she discover how much she really does need him, not just in the office but in her personal life as well."
He becomes her driver (Driving Miss Hathaway?)
and eventually he becomes her confidant.
"The two build a nice friendship that, it's a relief to report, doesn't bloom into a May-December."
"The problem is, that's about it."
The movie is as bland and superfluous as it gets.
Director Nancy Meyer sets up the inner-office environment with the reverie of shop-worn sitcom.
"It's pleasant and nice but it's only established so that Ben's old-school experience can teach the young a thing or two, but none of it has any significant payoff."
The people around the office are young whipper-snappers whose function in the film is to be young whipper-snappers and they don't matter either.
"They aren't developed as characters, they're just onlookers to Ben's successes."
Ben develops a half-written and pointless semi-sorta-romance with the company's on-site masseuse (Rene Russo) which goes nowhere and ALSO doesn't seem to matter.
The plot developments are pointless too.
Are we surprised to find that Jules' home life is burdened by the fact that her husband Matt gave up his career plans to be a stay-at-home dad?
Nearly all of Jules and Matt's scenes are dedicated to talking about the fact that they never see each other.
Hmmm.
For about the first hour of The Intern I was fairly bored.
"I liked Jules and Ben but I wanted the movie to clear out the junky plot points and just let them talk, let them be human beings who connected with each other."
"To that point, the movie had no real dramatic tensions ."
then it happens.
A dramatic situation develops that actually seems to give the movie some dramatic weight.
"Not to give anything away, but Ben discovers something about Matt that troubles him."
"When he brings it to Jules, the two have a heartfelt conversation that seems to be drawn from the characters, not from the screenplay."
"Unfortunately, the results of that dramatic event are crushed by a resolution that nobody - but nobody - is going be happy with."
The Intern was written and directed by Nancy Meyers who specializes in cupcake-sweet confections like It's Complicated and Something's Got to Give and the Father of the Bride movies.
Her films seem to have a consistent pattern.
They contain a germ of human interest wrapped up in a gimmicky script that is fit for a bad television sitcom.
"The exception is a great comedy she made 30 years ago called Irreconcilable Differences, about a kid who divorces her squabbling parents."
That movie had truth and human interest.
The Intern has only faint echos of humanity.
It has moments here and there when it shows the promise of what it might have been.
"It's a nice, sweet, uncomplicated movie that will begin disappearing from your mind before you get out of the theater and will have left you completely by the time you get to the car."
Well my cup of tea.
Binge watching it over n over again
"The intern no tiene mucho que contar tampoco que trasmitir es un film de domingo en la tarde que olvidaras a ver visto por que no tiene grandes cosas que aportar, no es una mala cinta pero realmente no tiene mucho que resaltar."
Enjoyed this way more than I expected.
"Super pleasant, easy watching if you need something feel-good."
De Niro and Hathaway were awesome.
"This is a heartwarming movie, despite a muddled plot, uneven performances, and some implausible situations."
Robert DeNiro stars as a retiree who led a traditional business life and is struggling with boredom during his retired years.
"He wants to get back out and meet people with purpose, and enrolls in a senior intern program at an internet startup."
Apparently this place only employs people under 35 who also happen to be loveable characters with some simple problems that DeNiro's character can solve.
DeNiro plays his character compellingly but a little too straight to convincingly be able to win over the heart of anyone he talks to in just a couple minutes.
"Sadly, the other actors are not up to caliber, with a wincingly badly directed and badly acted scene at the climax of the film."
"Also, don't think too hard about this movie, there are Plot Holes."
"But it is nice to see a movie valuing the wisdom that often comes with age, even if they overdo it quite a bit."
It is pleasant.
I really enjoyed watching this movie.
Robert De Niro comes across as genuine and sincere.
A throw back to when men were men.
Wheres my hanky?
Anne Hathaway gives a terrific performance as well.
This is a great date movie!
an amazing performance by de Niro as well as an awesome supporting cast.
This movie had me hooked from the word go.
I laughed; I cried; I was invested in the characters.
Absolutely loved this one!
Over all the movie was a great depiction of the unique friendship between generations.
The movie has some problems with it's plot especially with the family/husband storyline.
"The ending was abrupt, out of place and extremely unsatisfactory."
This movie made me CRYYYY so much!
Not the sad kind of cry but it teared me up in knowing how good the movie was!
It brings so much joy.
The movie really touched me through the bones.
The first time I cried so much for a movie because It was just soooo damn good!
It was truly the best and inspiring movie.
One of the best comedy-drama films I have ever seen.
The dialogue is hilarious.
The chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro is fantastic and funny.
Great work and lessons learned for life as a senior.
Let me know the importance of being a gentlemen.
"As a Comedy and Drama Film, This one is pretty good!"
"The Intern was a refreshing change of pace for me, theatrically speaking."
"A story with a heart, solid acting and quite a bit of realism."
"I love DeNiro and Hathaway anyway, but the chemistry between the two was very strong."
"The performances won't get recognized at the award level, but I haven't enjoyed DeNiro this much in a long time."
It was a departure for him and he was precious.
"The vibe of the film was reminiscent of similarly-themed 80s and 90s films, but I haven't really seen anything like this in almost 20 years."
They just don't make these kind of movies anymore.
"For someone my age, it was a pleasure to watch."
"De Niro plays a Mary Poppins/Jeeves type character who never puts a foot wrong.His unbelievable, sage, kindly older man (who can also get an erection) character is fairly 2 dimensional."
The movie tries too hard to be progressive.
Virtually shoving its modernity down our throats.
"Here's some feminism, take a kick in the nuts ageism, gender roles, boom!"
See ya!.
"No laughs, no genuine emotion."
"Overall, just pretty meh."
"Pretty much just ok. Had kind of touching dramatic moments as well as funny ones, and also digs a little deep at times that flow well with the movie dealing with topics like work-life balance, women in the workplace and infidelity."
"It felt kind of slow though and despite the fact that some of the characters do go through hard times, the DeNiros performance and the movie in general was so light hearted it was hard to really believe anything was at stake or anything bad would happen."
"Also the movie feels kind of like a giant Apple advertisement, but maybe that's just me."
I enjoyed the movie.
De'Niro taught the milleniels how to be classy
This movie had a lot of heart.
But it‚Äôs listed as a comedy and I must say the laughs were good but sparse.
This should be listed as a drama.
I was in the mood for a laugh and that‚Äôs why I picked this movie.
But as you‚Äôll see you‚Äôll actually share a few tears by the end.
If it‚Äôs a drama it‚Äôs 4 stars.
But if your looking for a comedy I would give it only 1 star.
Good luck.
Great movie.
Well written and a wonderful cast.
You‚Äôll laugh and maybe even cry a little.
Academy Award winner Robert DeNiro has been hitting bad times recently in terms of the quality of his film.
"Appearing in garbage such as ""Meet the Fockers"" and ""Little Fockers"" and ""Dirty Grandpa""."
It is nice to see that among the trash is a movie deserving of his talents and worth your time.
"""The Intern"" is not specatular by any means."
However there is a lot to like about it.
The thing to like the most is DeNiro.
He carries this movie on his shoulders and does so very well.
He also has very good chemistry with Academy Award winner Anne Hathaway.
Their scenes together seem very genuine.
Almost like they are not scripted.
He alone makes this movie worth seeing.
"The script is a little formulaic in terms of its storyline, but it still makes for a entertaining film that I do recommend."
Original mostly clean comedy
Loved this side of DeNiro.
"He's so known for his tough guy roles, that it was refreshing to see this very reserved performance."
"He and Ann Hathaway made this a very touching movie, with a lot of commentary on life and what should be important."
"Sweet, touching, well-developed story for today."
"Diabolical romantic non-drama, written and directed by Nancy Meyers, so all the blame rests with her."
De Niro has his own reasons for lining up these turkeys.
"His is the only decent performance, trying to extract pathos and subtlety where there is none."
Anne Hathaway is incredibly irritating.
A real clunker.
"This movie is really charming, especially in the beginning."
"And as it was going along I kept thinking don't mess this up, don't mess this up."
"I think it goes adrift a bit, but I still liked it overall."
I can see where some people would not like this movie at all.
"Robert De Niro's character is too perfect, the ending is tied up way too neat, the scene where they break into the mother's house belongs in a different movie, and so on."
"I tried not to let those things bother me though, because I really enjoyed the two leads and I wanted to see where their stories would go."
"If you've seen any other Nancy Meyers movies (somehow I've seen all of them), you know what you're getting into here."
There's nothing challenging or all that memorable but you'll feel good after watching it.
Thoroughly enjoyed it!
It was generally a good movie.
The movie was intriguing and heart warming
"Nice film, easy watching"
This is a cute and funny movie!
cliched but delightfully so
Loved it!
"Heart-warming, funny."
Nice chemistry between De Niro & Hathaway.
By far one of my new favorite movies.
Definitely in my top 10.
Very biased and an obvious propaganda piece.
Written and directed by Nancy Meyers starring movie veteran icon Robert DeNiro as Ben Whittaker coming out of retirement and eventually being accepted as an intern for internet selling sensation CEO magnet Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway)
An average feel good movie.
Cool concept.
Was better in the beginning.
Pretty good but not amazing.
"SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Well Greg, Robert De Niro doesn t appear to be in any hurry to retire -- both in real life and in this movie."
"GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) I found the whole thing (re)tiring."
"Let s recap: SCOTT: We meet Ben Whitaker (Robert De Niro), a 70-year-old widower who is restless and dissatisfied with his life as a retiree."
"While searching for something meaningful to do with his time, he stumbles across an advertisement for an senior internship program."
"He decides to apply as an intern at a company called About The Fit, a fast-growing business that sells fashionable clothing online."
Ben s interview goes well and he is hired as an intern.
"GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) But his new boss is Jules: a high-strung workaholic young woman (Anne Hathaway) who micromanages everyone."
At first she shuns Ben claiming that she doesn t need an assistant.
Ben employs his old-school discipline of never leaving the building before the boss and picking up the boss s loose ends.
"One day, he notices her driver is a bit too drunk to drive and he takes his place as Jules driver."
And before you know it they re best buddies.
"SCOTT: If you ve been following our movie reviews over the years, you know that I haven t been much of a fan of Robert DeNiro s recent body of work."
"With The Intern, there is now some promising indication that his slump is over."
DeNiro shines in his portrayal of a retired gentleman from a bygone era who takes on the role of a rookie intern in a quest to inject his geezerly life with some meaning.
"He not only finds what he is looking for, he also manages to endow several other people s lives with richness, wisdom, and direction."
The hero s journey here takes on a unique and interesting form.
"Ben starts out as a useless minion to Jules, but over time he evolves into a trusted sidekick."
"By the end of the film, Ben is arguably Jules equal, and also her mentor."
"To the extent that Ben and Jules are equals, one could argue that they are buddy heroes who follow the classic pattern of being at odds with each other at first and then grow into BFFL s. Whether Ben is her sidekick, mentor, or buddy is open to interpretation here."
"Regardless, their relationship evolves and becomes transformative for them both."
GREG: I thought this movie was too reminiscent of last year s The Interns starring Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson.
"Similarly, we have two older salesmen who teach old-school lessons to the Internet savvy youngsters of Google."
The Intern is a little more personal in that Ben takes on a more mentorly role early in the film.
"In fact, he much reminds me of a butler similar to Hobson in 1981 s Arthur - or even Mary Poppins."
He takes Jules daughter to kindergarten and fixes her relationship with her stay-at-home husband.
"Scott, we just reviewed The Martian where astronaut Watney graduates from hero to teacher."
In that review we noted the ultimate destination for the hero is to become a mentor.
And I think we see this pattern revisited here in The Intern.
Ben has been a leader of a major company and has retired to a sedate life.
"Now, with this new opportunity, he has a chance to pass on his wealth of knowledge not only to Jules, but also to all the members of her staff."
He has found his final destination.
"SCOTT: Greg, this movie has a sweetness to it that I found extremely appealing."
"Both of the lead characters need something, and what they need can only be found with help from the other."
Jules wants to be seen as independent and so she resists Ben s help.
She is smart enough to know that Ben represents no threat to her authority and legitimacy as a leader.
"So she bends, and as befitting a good hero story, her receptivity to change is brought about by a deep hurt -- the devastating reality of her husband cheating on her."
"As you point out, Greg, Ben himself has already accomplished in life many of the goals that Jules is now seeking."
"And so he is developmentally ready to just assume a helping role, a mentoring function."
"As they say, when the student is ready, the teacher will appear."
The first half of this movie is devoted to Jules not being ready.
"All heroes are humbled in some way, and this ends up being the key to her openness to transformation."
I enjoyed watching these two heroes do all the things that heroes do when they are in two different stages of life.
"Thirty or forty years in the future, I can easily envision Jules doing all the things that Ben is doing in this movie."
"GREG: Actually, Scott, I found this movie somewhat patronizing."
"Aside from Jules, all the other characters in the story were caricatures and stereotypes of millennials."
"Ben is seated with the other interns, all of whom are recent college graduates."
Young Davis is being kicked out of his parent s basement.
So Ben takes him in and teaches him the importance of getting out of bed on time and dressing in a suit and tie.
Young Jason is too interested in partying and Ben shows him the way of moderation.
And young administrative assistant Becky is drawn to tears when she fears Ben is getting more attention than she is.
I ve got a degree in marketing from Harvard Wah wah wah And of course Ben calms her down with a pat and a hanky - then pushes Jules to delegate some of her authority to Becky.
"These are all stereotypes that will appeal to the older crowd, who appear to be the target audience."
There s no nuance here.
"Jules is the female Mark Zuckerberg who needs a nudge to realize that if she s going to play with the big boys, she has to grow a pair."
And it s Ben s gentle nudging that gets her there.
I found it all very patronizing verging on condescending.
"SCOTT: Sorry you felt that way, Greg."
"The Intern represents a comeback of sorts for actor Robert De Niro, who shines as an older man looking for a way to live a meaningful life."
"His heroic urge to mentor others is fulfilled when he is partnered with a rising business star, played with great zest and skill by Anne Hathaway."
"This movie accomplishes what all good hero stories should accomplish it teaches us that when we re young, we need good mentors."
"And that when we re old, we need to give back, to do good mentoring."
There s nothing condescending about needing help and giving help; it s just a reality of lifespan development.
"For giving us a sweet tale of two lives intertwined across generations, I award this movie 4 Reels out of 5."
"The two hero s journeys of our lead characters are fun to watch, and they show how two people who need each other can help each other grow and evolve."
"Ben is wise enough to know he needs to come out of retirement to meet his need to mentor, and Jules becomes wise enough to recognize that she needs mentoring."
The movie s ending is ambiguous -- does Ben no longer need to mentor?
"This dual hero story is moving, sometimes silly, but compelling overall."
I give this pair 4 Heroes out of 5.
The supporting cast is adequate but not terribly memorable.
Another intern is a comic figure.
One of Jules employees is also comedic in a pathetic sort of way.
There s no real villainy to speak of.
This is a story of people growing and developing more than it is a story of overcoming any particular villain.
"Overall, the supporting characters earn a decent rating of 3 out of 5."
"Movie: Cast: Hero: GREG: I found The Intern to be an overly simplistic, melodramatic, under humored and pandering to the older generation."
Even the idea that a woman could run her own company was undermined by her having to be taught the values of bygone days by an older man.
"I felt it was a boring, and like it or not, condescending look at a fantasy of modern business."
I can t muster more than 2 Reels out of 5 for The Intern.
I ll grant you a nice hero s journey for both Ben and Jules.
It s a pattern I don t think we ve seen a lot of - a mentor who needs his up-and-coming apprentice.
And an apprentice who needs the mentoring of a former hero to rise to her own potential.
I give these odd-couple buddy heroes 3 out of 5 Heroes.
The supporting cast were all weak cardboard cutouts of young people stereotypes.
I ve already outlined my thoughts on them.
2 out of 5 Cast points.
Movie: Cast: Hero:
"30-year-old CEO, Jules (Anne Hathaway) who has grown up her company with more than 200 employees in a year and a half."
Time is too short for her to be perfect for both home and work.
"She gets a 70-year-old intern, Ben (Robert De Niro) who have been living his life and trying to start unconventional life after retirement."
Ben's first job as a senior intern coming through a senior intern program is Jules's secretary.
She feels uncomfortable to him because he is older than her.
"However, she starts to open her mind to him, who is always polite and attentive to her."
It cannot be found free time of her life in the company who is involved in the all managements of in the company and rides a bike in order to manage her physical fitness in the company.
"Jules' company is a big online shopping mall, and all the systems are very high-tech, but Ben is still analog."
"However, he fully adapts to work in the job due to his rich lifestyle and unique sociability."
"He has used to analog, but his mind is still hot."
"Although he may seem trivial, it is in fact crucial in terms of today's concern over different from the average 70 years old people we imagine."
"However, as like the impression given by the title ""intern"", in the beginning of this movie, an unusual intern gives the impression of enjoying an interesting intern, but it starts to escape from the topic more and more."
"Even though it is not an ordinary intern, it is what happen when trying to break through the point that if the company looks reality, there are many restrictions."
"When it shows the company, it uses to be able to make a horizontal and autonomous image, rather than a vertical structure, but it uses to utilize images of Ann Hathaway's active and Robert Hathaway's warm."
"Fortunately, the images of the actor are naturally melting into the film, they are helpful to make the movie brightening."
Even though it is unrealistic to express the company.
"These are the characters that are unhate, so they become more empathetic and more sympathetic to the changes and events involved."
It becomes a great attraction to the movie.
My discussion of the events is in fact addressing the larger matter of limitations of situations.
"It has succeeded naturally to make tenderness in the beginning, but repetitive situations make the audience bored and have forced the limitations of setting from the setting of a drastic change."
It might be said that this movie is chiefly about interns on the company.
"But the problem with this movie, in my view, is that movies have become closer to mentor than intern."
It turs out as a campaign to hire a mentor as old intern.
"The view of the movie, which focused on interns, is narrowed the focus on the two people."
"Events of outside of the company are increasing rather than outside of the company, and even an event that is kind of offence, is added for a tension of the movie."
"At this point, the fresh characters have only difference from the company, and it is similar to the relationship between father and daughter."
"Ultimately, what is at skate here is that the relationship just as mentor between the two, rather than satire of company's culture through comparison and contrast between the older generation who devote themselves to the company for the half their lives and the younger generation who start to delicate to the company."
"It may be that the life of an intern is portrayed as an ambiguous point, and may have succeeded in finding intern like an angel in fairy tales."
"Funny enough, and not too many expected things happens."
But I grew a bit tired by the end.
"Although I hate to admit it, ''I'm just a big bowl of mush'' too."
That is why I enjoyed this heart felt movie.
It resonated with me.
I enjoyed De Niro and Hathaway's on-screen chemistry.
They made a great team.
The most romantic platonic movie...
"DeNiro and Hathaway's genuine chemistry, plus beautiful signature set pieces from Meyers, makes The Intern, pleasantly charming."
Got kinda lame towards the end with marriage.
Her husband was ugly and gay.
Ann looked cute
"It's a sweet film with a lot of flaws, but it also has a realistic view on life for this woman and that touches many other people at different points in their life."
The Intern is a nice feel good film directed by Nancy Meyers staring Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro.
The film is a bit predictable and vanilla but has a lot of hart.
There are very solid performances in the film particularly by Robert De Niro who gives one of the best performances in the last few years.
"However, De Niro character is a little too perfect."
Adam DeVine is a little under used.
I loved it.
"It was a wholesome, simple yet intriguing movie."
"Anne Hathaway and Robert DeNiro seem like an unlikely pair, but were so easy to watch."
"The intern tells the story of Ben Withaker, a widowed 70 year old retired successful businessman, wonderfully played by Robert De Niro."
Ben has taken Einstein's quote 'Life is like riding a bicycle.
"To keep your balance, you must keep moving.'"
to heart.
"As he struggles to keep himself occupied with, yoga, tai chi, mandarin and violin classes, and ignoring the advances of various senior ladies, he manages to land an internship to an overgrown start up that struggles to keep up with its own success."
The founder and CEO Jules Ostin (Ann Hathaway) is a success driven woman on her early thirties.
"Jules, with unconventional methods and business vision has driven her once small business, About The Fit, to the top list of fashion e-commerce sites."
During the first good part of the movie Meyer's makes great use of De Niro's charisma to portray the angst and fears of a whole generation that more often than not is too easily dismissed and ignored.
"As De Niro predictively proofs himself valuable and wins over the millennials who at first looked down on him, the viewer starts to fall in love with the chemistry that an enthusiastic Hathaway and De Niro build up."
"We like the pair, and it shows."
"Ben is respectful, dresses in a suit, keeps his cool and basically does everything better than everybody else."
"The senior man invisibly brings to Jules life, that has been overtaken by fast paced meetings and 14 hour working days, much needed support and calmness."
"As the film progresses, Meyers slowly drifts the focus away from Ben's impact on About The Fit, to focus on the founder's life."
"Jules is married to a stay at home dad, with whom she has an adorable 9 year old daughter."
"Her family feels that she is not giving them enough attention, while the investors are pressuring her to hire a new CEO."
"Here, the Meyer's work hits and elbow point, and slowly becomes more about proving a point than telling a compelling story."
"We painfully see how the movie degenerates into a rant about feminism, relationships, success, manlyhood and well, so many disperse things that it resembles more to a 3am Tumblr post than an A-list studio production."
"For most of its running time The Intern gets off to De Niro's amiability and Hathaway high energy, but as the movie progresses to the end we are left with a bitter-sweet aftertaste."
We can't help but think that Meyers did to the intern what a freshman college student does to his midterm paper.
"It starts promising, but the spectator quickly ends up feeling like a literature professor reading a paper pushed trough with unhealthy amounts of caffeine."
Such a wonderful surprise.
I loved Anna and Robert together.
"Comedia rom√°ntica (Hathaway no sale en otra cosa) con un aderezo muy especial y sabroso, el personaje y la actuaci√≥n del Sr. Deniro le dan un extra a la pel√≠cula que la vuelve buena y digna de verse."
"So so, cute, temporary distraction :)"
i enjoyed this film.
not exactly big on story line but chilled.
thanks sky comedy for screening it.
Better then anticipated ... Well casted and a good story with some heart ...
"Great movie, love the performance and the storyline."
Makes you feel happy and not as scared of the future as you were before.
i liked this movie!
De Niro is SO out of tough guy character from younger days.
But my final analysis of this film is that it could NEVER happen in reality.
See it for what it is.... a sentimental but not credible plot.
I didn't expect much from the intern but I was surprised it's a decent film.
The best thing about this film are the performances especially from Robert de Niro.
This is one of his best performances in years.
The script is well written and full of laughs.
The movie does run a little bit too long and there's a couple of pointless subplots that really don't add anything to the main story though.
"Despite Robert De Niro's and Anne Hathaway's great performances, ""The Intern"" misses a lot of opportunities to make its plot more interesting."
"I've had this movie recorded for ages, and so glad I saved it."
"Another inspired performance from Robert de Niro, such a versatile actor."
Nancy Meyers movies are always so upbeat and positive and everything always works out and the scenery and settings are vibrant.
They can be a nice change of pace every now and again.
"Not a bad rom-com, where (thankfully) De Niro is not the love interest - he's a senior-citizen intern trying to fit into the new world (after 40 years in the phonebook business!)"
"Hathaway's good as the tech-entrepreneur who's pulled in a thousand directions, and his sage advice help her."
That's pretty much the plot.
"Not hilarious, but some fun and funny moments, especially with Devine & Pearlman."
Russo is wasted and I'm not sure the ending is suitable.
Robert DeNiro is lucky that I can separate the art from the artist.
All in all I thought this movie was amazing.
"While it might not be overly realistic at times, I still like to hope for a world where this kind of story would be possible."
"It runs a bit long occasionally, but I would certainly say that it is worth the time to check it out."
Superb - how films should be.
An utter breath of fresh air.
"With good performances from Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro, as well as competent writing and direction from Nancy Meyers, The Intern is a perfect example of a 3 out of 4 star movie; it's a surprisingly entertaining but uncomplicated film."
"I can't object to most of the many criticisms levelled at it, but the movie's a genuinely pleasing and kind-hearted experience if you're willing to give yourself over to it."
"In following a 70-year-old retired man who can effectively resolve just about every problem Hathaway's character faces, it has justifiably been criticised for having an outdated, paternalistic bent."
"Part of the reason the film fails in this regard, I think, is because it tries to deal with both aging and gender roles and doesn't consider how a nice idea in one context (lonely old man reintegrates into society by helping those with less life experience) can be ill-conceived in another (perfect man repeatedly saves woman)."
"Still, the film is so gentle and charming my critical impulses were mostly disarmed for the film's running time."
The most troubling moment is Hathaway's character's (much-discussed) speech in which she proclaims the value of traditional masculinity and expresses sympathy for the supposed infantilization of contemporary men.
What she fails to discuss is how this may be seen as a by-product of the privileges afforded men within a patriarchal system.
"The issue is not, perhaps, that men have been disadvantaged and can't grow up, it's that the benefits they receive by default mean they don't have to grow up."
"Regardless, it should be noted that this speech is given when the character is dangerously intoxicated and the De Niro character himself doesn't actually really fit within a traditional idea of masculinity."
"He's professional and chivalrous, sure, but he's also a self-described ""pile of mush"" and a self-proclaimed feminist."
"Perhaps this is wishful thinking, but the film does provide fodder for an interpretation in which Hathaway's speech is not read as accurate."
"Bonus points to Meyers for including enough sort-of allusions to Taxi Driver (De Niro practising phrases in the mirror, De Niro driving people around) that the film can almost be read as a kind of subversive anti-Taxi Driver in which the subject is not violence and alienation but kindness and simple human connection."
"Oh, and add me to the chorus of people pleased that the film is, for a Hollywood picture, relatively age-appropriate in its approach to romance (Rene Russo is still substantially younger than De Niro, but at least he's not dating someone half his age)."
Yawwwwn.
Oh... pretty pictures and actors!
I was in a blue mood and watched this since it was its last day on HBO.
"With Bobby D, I wanted to see it not expecting much."
I loved it!
I could see a tv series spin off.
"It's one of those movies that feels like it was written 15 years before it was made, then 'updated' just before cameras rolled."
"The producers may have tried to make this appeal to a wide audience, but it's really geared towards people over 60. the jokes are stale, the characters are across the board stock, and the acting is either too much or too little."
The ending is simply rubbish.
Avoid this one.
This is a fun film especially if you like Robert De Nero and Ann Hathaway.Give it a watch it'll be better than you think.Robert De Nero is a great actor.
"Overlong, sentimental, sappy, cliche-ridden and incredibly watchable."
Entire cast is great including 2/3 of Workaholics and new hire Robert DeNiro.
"Anne Hathaway, with everything she says ending in an annoying growl, was a little difficult for me to deal with, but I'm not saying that I don't like her - I do."
She just needs to work on her voice quality.
"Robert DeNiro, on the other hand, was great - one of my favorite actors - and this was something completely different from his usual gangster or CIA type characters."
"And I thought Christina Scherer as the flustrated secretary, ""Becky"" was absolutely adorable!"
"I saw this movie on store shelves, but had some doubts about it."
"Someone recently recommended it, so I borrowed it from the library."
"After watching it twice, the next day I went to the store and bought it."
Great movie!
Okay film which explores both aging and the difficulties career women face outside the workforce.
Killed 2 hours on a plane.
"Hey, this film is pretty decent."
"Despite the endless venture of Robert De Niro into being type-cast in bad comedies and the post-Oscar notoriety of Anne Hathaway, the film turned out to be a fine cooperative effort of the two, with De Niro's subdued father-figure perfectly complimented the bright but arrogant youthfulness of Hathaway."
"The film did try ""to be cool"" but its sincere approach to the world of start-ups should be commended, especially given its very progressive but not too provocative touch on feminism and the conflict between career and family."
"It might get some laughs out of the audience too, albeit cheap laughs."
"Many things about this film can be considered unrealistic, including its heart-warming ending, but unrealistic optimism is sometimes still in need, especially in such ""dark"" worlds of young entrepreneurs and old ""retirees""."
"One last thing - the costume designer of this film deserves an award, or at least a raise, as not only De Niro and Hathaway, but even small roles of nameless supporting actors/actresses were dressed extremely well."
"Una pelicula diferente a las demas, la trama prometia, fue lo esperado."
"Cheesy, but... kind of sweet."
"Um ex-vice presidente de uma empresa de listas telefonicas se aposenta e percebe que precisa de uma ocupa√ß√£o para sua vida e arruma um est√°gio para idosos, sendo que l√° encontra uma propriet√°ria que n√£o consegue mais controlar seu tempo e deixa de lado sua familia e n√£o est√° gerindo mais a contento sua empresa, por√©m esse idoso vai lhe a ajudar a ver que precisa dar mais valor a sua familia (pois seu marido come√ßa a lhe trair) e tudo se resolve..."
Sweet comedy.
Di Nero is surprisingly amusing as an older guy looking for purpose surrounded by technology and millenniums.
A better-than-average dramedy that is held up by fantastic performances from the two leads.
You just can't expect less from Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway.
A decent heartwarming comedy by Nancy Meyers.
great movie for young ladies to see their potential
"Have you ever watched ""The Intern""?"
I at first watched the commercial on TV and it impressed me.
"If you watch this film, you will absolutely inspired it."
"""The Intern"" is one of the best touching film."
"This is a 2015 American love comedy film directed, written and produced by Nancy Meyers."
The film starts Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway in the two leading roles.
"The film was released on September 25, 2015 by Warner Bros. Ben(Robert) was nothing to do in his life because his wife was passed away, and he retired from his job."
"On the other hand, Jules(Anne) planned to hire senior person."
Then Ben applied for it and passed it to take charge of Jules.
But Jules dosen't like senior person because of her mother.
"So, she didn't assign a job to Ben, but Ben always waiting for her to assign a job."
"While he was waiting, he cleaned the office up, became a Jules changed her mind to Ben."
"So, this story is about they having the rocky road to success and they are in love with others."
"I watched this movie four times because this is really nice, impressive and inspired Jules who working hard woman."
"After watched this, I was thinking about study hard like her."
"Until they become friends, there were a lot of things about job, love, and friend."
"If you watch this movie, you would absolutely be exhilarated."
But I think I want this film to show more deeply love.
Apart from that it is really good story.
"A retired successful business owner and widower lands an internship at a fashion website run by a young, career-driven woman."
Exceeded my expectations.
Unforgettably amazing and heartwarming.
Una de esas pel√≠culas livianas pero con buenas actuaciones que si te toca en el momento indicado te llega y te gusta mucho.
Interesting premise where the intern is a retired senior citizen.
Originality basically stops there.
This movie relied on its two stars.
"Hathaway is worthy, but DeNiro's brilliance carries an otherwise mediocre film."
"The movie seems to be a set up to glorify a good ole boy, but eventually morphs into a solid feel-good comedy/drama."
"simpaticen film epten, De Niro e smislen za ulogava :)"
Old washup man pretends to be an intern... worse movie ever.
Not bad.
Held my attention.
Both De Niro and Hathaway were very convincing.
"sweet little film, but the ending was terrible."
and no way would any woman be that forgiving.
nope.
A film about a retired man who goes back into working to escape the boring environment he was in.
"Robert De Niro plays the intern or what I like to call, The Superman of a clothes company."
He connects with the young CEO played by Anne Hathaway who is stressed out trying to tackle on the job while being with her family.
"This film is not going to be a masterpiece, but I see it as an entertaining film that you are inevitably going to have a good time in, even with a simple story, it offers heart and the connection between this CEO and the much older intern is what really makes this film amazing and important."
I was surprised how much I liked it!
"This is not great cinema, and will probably be forgotten long before Citizen Kane, or Casablanca, or Cries and Whispers, but it was fun to watch and we enjoyed it, start to finish."
"It was somewhat sappy, highly predictable, and entirely without anything that would make you question its PG-13 MPAA rating."
But these were people you could see yourself sitting down to have a meal with and know that you would enjoy it.
"Anne Hathaway was radiantly beautiful as the high-powered entrepreneur of a wildly successful eCommerce fashion house, whose marriage and home life was suffering, while Robert DeNiro came across as a father figure while serving as her intern."
"It was good to see Rene Russo and Linda Lavin and to hear Mary Kay Place's voice, as each played small, but important roles."
"I hesitate to call it a romantic comedy, as the two leads were never in danger of becoming lovers (although one would have to say they each came to value the other as more than colleagues) and there wasn't a lot of laugh out loud moments, but the overall tone of the film left one feeling good about the people and their relationships."
Probably what I liked best from this movie was seeing Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway as the two lead characters here as I really like the both of them.
Anne looked especially gorgeous in this one and did a great job as usual.
De Niro is very likeable too.
"The supporting cast is fine enough, not really annoying except for one of the interns named Davis, but it didn't really do anything to take away from this film."
"If anything maybe it's just a tad too long, but overall it's a good watch."
Not so bad story of an older guy wanting to feel wanted again
4 and a half stars.
"Happy, calm film."
throughly enjoyed
Cute.
"Predictable, but enjoyable."
Most of the backstory doesn't work - but the chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway's millennial start-up tribe is entirely watchable.
enjoyable feel good film as an oap gets a job as an intern in a young workforce
Oh this is so lovely!
"If you're in the mood for a sweet, poignant, uplifting story then this is your film!"
"Feelgood komedi, perfekt under en flygning!"
:D
A nice movie that is easy to watch but will also be easy to forget
Started of great and ended horribly.
"I liked it very much, light funny and happy."
"Dragged at points, but still very funny overall."
I love De Niro - he's sincere and self deprecating and loveable however Hathaway is unconvincing playing the same character as usual.
It's a sweet little movie but the ending is very unsatisfactory.
If it was anyone other than De Niro this would get 1 star.
"The premise might seem funny, but it's a gentle comedy at best, all seen through the eyes of Robert De Niro's character, who is instantly forgettable."
"Started off with promise, good actors , reasonable story, however failed to progress, no depth and just stopped without an ending."
"it's not the comedy that will make you laugh, it's the comedy that will make you smile."
"Nancy Meyers makes movies for women, and this time for senior as well."
"There is no single story, more like fragments of people's lives."
Senior internship program of an e-commerce start-up founded by a young female already set the scene up for the drama and conflicts.
"Women can relate to this movie, especially women with a purpose."
"It was also nice to see the office scenes with a lot of open space, MacBooks, large windows, and the CEO bikes in the office."
easy to watch.. not too taxing in the brain.. crap ending though and they miscast the husband of Anne Hathaway completely..
This movie surprised me.
"I thought it was going to constantly make jokes about older people and while it does have a few jokes of that nature, it is more about how mentorship can positively change you."
"It was nice to see a movie where the characters are all basically good, but flawed."
It also makes you feel good and warms the heart.
You need that from time to time.
"Have grown up watching De Nero playing great roles in Godfather part 2, Casino, Goodfellows etc."
"Really didn't, want to watch this movie because he was so far removed from this genre."
Sat down and watched the flick with my three girls and really enjoyed it.
"BTW just don't understand the bad wraps on Anne Hathaway, thought she was great"
"La directora Nancy Meyers sabe hacer unos estupendos ""chick flicks"": ""It's Complicated"", ""Something's Gotta Give"" y ""What Women Want"", son algunos ejemplos."
"""The Intern"" no es la excepci√≥n: la historia de un hombre viudo de 70 a√±os (un estupendo Robert De Niro) que termina convirti√©ndose en un practicante de una empresa de ropa por internet es definitivamente entra√±able."
"La qu√≠mica entre De Niro y Anne Hathaway (su joven jefe) es maravillosa y hace de esta cinta algo muy, pero muy entretenido."
"Good chemistry between Hathaway and De Niro carries this movie off and anyone over 55 will enjoy the ""ageless"" focus."
Recommended.
Top movie really enjoyed this one
"Personally one of my favourite movies now every time i watch it I still love it, Great Film."
The Intern is without a shadow of doubt a 2015 film.
"20 years ago, The Intern would not of been made."
"Atleast, not like this."
"It handles a driven, young working woman with seemingly infinite hustle and a stay at home father with nary a hint of ridicule."
The characters accept this as simply as you would wearing socks with shoes.
"The elephant in the room is Ben, played supurbly by Robert De Niro with just the right mix of understated sensitivity and decades of life experience without the ""I told you so"" snark."
"Ben's the very senior intern to Anne Hathaway's Jules Ostin, a hustlin' 21st century sister doin' it for herself, her daughter & her stay at home husband."
"Ben never condescends, is always humble and willing to go above and beyond for the good of his motley crew of co-workers."
This is taken to it's logical conclusion during a daring heist Ben heads up with his fellow desk jockeys to delete a disparaging email their not-so-fearless female leader accidently sent to her mother.
"Easily the film's most ridiculous moment, but it didn't outstay it's welcome and serves as an effective palate cleanser in the middle of the movie."
"There's an interesting twist a little after the hiest which was definitely needed, because as good as The Intern is, it never layed down a firm mission statement for either of the leads to accomplish by the end, and the twist gave some welcome drama to what I found to be a very enjoyable, sweet and likable film."
"Fine, but nothing incredible or groundbreaking."
"Despite having a solid and intriguing premise, it primarily coasts on the chemistry of its large cast."
Bonus points for the interior design porn.
Made me feel good!!
It's ice cream.
plain.
simple.
"This is one of those perfect, late night TBS flicks that you catch when you're hanging out, ironically enough, at your Grandparent's house."
The film is simple and the cast is earnest and charming.
"Leave your cynicism at the door, and you'll be fine - even when you get to the abrupt ending."
"a great movie with a lot of potential.. a film with perfect flow of story, great collection of plot and an awesome pair...incredible cast but still, robert di nero!!!"
what an actor!!!
you never fail to amaze us with ur charming performance.. never ever!!!
always be the right person with great performance!!
and anna was also incredible so were the rest of the cast!!!
overall full on fun.. great entertainment!!!
nancy made an incredible film... hats off....
Really good.
Wanna watch for the 2nd time :)
8/31/16 I actually disliked watching this film.
"At the beginning, I did enjoy it because it was ""cute""."
"After a while though, it became very obvious that this story was made up and I could envision someone sitting there writing the script."
In-authenticity is never a good thing.
"Then, about half way through the film, it becomes much darker, and quite frankly, just depressing."
The resolution in the end isn't really a good resolution either.
"So, to me it is fake and depressing."
Not great entertainment if you ask me!
"It's good until the end, not such a big fan of the ending but other then that it's a great movie and great cast"
It was quite a nice film to be honest.
Anne Hathaway never looked better ..
I actually kind of liked her after all these years ...
Bit cheesy but it is worth watching
Really good movie.
Brilliant acting and storyline.
Enjoyable but forgettable.
A better movie for De Niro then some of his recent stuff.
The ending left a lot to be desired.
It just ended.
Dumb.
Relatable and very relevant.
"Dynamic between characters was sweet, funny."
"And genuine,"
It was ok.
I felt it started off strong but kind of fizzled as it wore on.
I actually thought it'd be more of a comedy but the jokes it did have was the first half of the movie.
The acting by De Niro and Hathaway was great but I hated the abrupt ending.
It was a nice storyline that I enjoyed watching.
"What a great movie, I didn't want it to end.For the last half of the movie, I kept thinking she was going to hire Ben as the CEO though."
"Cute, yet thin storyline."
Enjoyed the pairing of Hathaway and De Niro.
"Felt cheated by Hathaway's character's obvious storyline and wished they'd given De Niro's character more of a story....that being said, maybe that was point; to have a senior character quietly and resolutely and prominently affect one's life."
"Thought De Niro was great with the younger men, providing guidance and support."
Nice watching the young men evolve.
Disneyesque predictability
I am not one to watch these types of movies.
I tend to prefer horror/action.
"However, this one strays from the expectations of its kind."
(spoiler?)
"I was almost expecting a scene where DeNiro's character would mess up and everyone would see that he is not perfect, but in the end they would find they love him anyway, but it was what I hoped: The 'elder wisdom' he provided seemed to be the answer to everything and I think it's what is lacking in recent generations."
I am glad this movie was made.
"It shows what is missing-- what is needed in not only the youth of today, but the companies of today."
good job!
"Funny, and a pretty witty satire about the politics in today's business office."
Just the right mix of serious and humor.
Good date night movie.
Heartfelt movie... Great story and fantastic acting.
"A retired 70-year-old widower, Ben (played by Robert De Niro), is bored with retired life."
He applies to a be a senior intern at an online fashion retailer and gets the position.
"The founder of the company is Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), a tireless, driven, demanding, dynamic workaholic."
"Ben is made her intern, but this is a nominal role - she doesn't intend to give him work and it is just window dressing."
"However, Ben proves to be quite useful and, more than that, a source of support and wisdom."
"Good, and surprisingly so."
I was expecting a farcical half-baked comedy about how an old guy rejoins the work force and struggles with modern gadgets and work processes.
There are a few examples of that but the movie is far more than a story about generational differences.
"It's more a drama than a comedy, and is a good one too."
"There's themes of generational wisdom, not judging people by their age (or anything superficial) and making the most of people's talents."
"It's also a movie about starting over, and doing what you enjoy."
"Moreover, it's simply a nice story."
Solid work by Robert De Niro in the lead role.
"He doesn't do bad performances, but that hasn't stopped him in the past from taking on roles and movies that are well below his standards."
This is not one of those roles or movies.
"Sensitively played, and ideal for the role."
"Good work too by Anne Hathaway, who is very convincing as the go-getting entrepreneur."
Bottom line Robert D made this movie!
Really enjoyed it!
Anne Hathaway also played a great part also .
A film that differentiates the young and old generation.
I would definitely say it is the director's best film.
"I have liked her other films, but this is a lot different from them."
I mean it was well written screenplay with much better understood the contemporary world than just focusing on the relationships as usual.
So the addition of digital world stuffs made all the difference and I completely enjoyed it.
"Don't think it would be another 'The Internship' as I initially thought, but slightly it is and much better everyway."
You are going to agree with me that the film's posters or the trailers were not very impressive as what the actual film did to grab our full attention.
"The two hours films are always a concern to me, but when a film like this runs for that long, I can even sit for another half an hour."
"Anyway, with this story and its runtime, the pace was incredible."
"When there's something interesting is going on, we forget to focus on the flaws and enjoy our time, which is what I exactly did in here."
"This is not a comedy where you're going to laugh openly loud, it is a comedy in the sense of the set of characters the film has."
"I mean, the story is about the digital business and most of them who are into the computers are considered as geeks."
"So theirs world is nothing, but just hooked to their works and forgetting the actual world around them."
"Even for the someone in the next room, they tweet."
"For them to remind only they've changed, not the physical world and that's where our main character who is old and wise influence the younger generation people."
So the actors were undoubtedly the best thing apart from the direction and the story.
The 73 years old Robert De Niro still impressing with his extraordinary character display.
"I don't know whoever was in mind when it was written, but this role perfectly fits none other than him."
And then there's Anne Hathaway on the opposite side who equaled with De Niro with her part.
"From the narration point of view, it started with DeNiro's, but quickly around in the middle it took a circle to cover others as well."
And then comes from the professional to the personal life topic when it was developed and brought a small family who were affected by the workaholic mother.
"So if you enter it expecting a comedy, probably you won't disappoint with what it delivers against your wish which is a heartwarming drama with some emotional moments."
"Surely recommended, especially the youngsters who're addicted to the digital world!"

Loved this movie from beggining to end!
"I don't know, Robert De Niro seems too perfect to turn me off here."
Really enjoyed this movie!

"The Intern is funny, charming, and heartwarming."
A movie about an older man that is retired going back into the outdoor world and getting a job as a intern in a young people work place is a great plot.
"I thought this movie was going to be bad, but it was not."
"However, towards the end of the movie it does get kind of boring."
"Overall, it is a great movie."
Robert De Niro's and Anne Hathaway's best movie yet.
Two thumbs up!
I would very much suggest this movie.
"*** Average I am internally grateful that you are taking a few minutes out of your day to read my cheesy review of Writer-Director Nancy Meyers' comedy ""The Intern""."
I hope you make it through this puntership with flying colors.
"Anyways, the movie stars Robert De Niro as Ben Whittaker."
"Ben is a 70 year old widower who is living out retired days, but needs to fill a void."
He comes across an opportunity to be an intern in a senior citizens' internship program for a start-up fashion online company.
"Anne Hathaway co-stars as Jules, the Founder of the company who at first is reluctant to work with an older crowd, but then takes a genuine liking to Ben as not only a dependable intern, but a father figure."
"Of course, there are conflicts that are incorporated into the film that causes their relationship some challenges, and Jules' own relationship with her husband."
"I admired how Meyers directed the first hour of the movie, but then it looked like ""The Intern"" ran out of steam during the second half with too many elongated scenes; and that is why I could not give ""The Intern"" a review promotion."
"I did like De Niro as Ben, and Hathaway as Jules was not too shabby either."
"""The Intern"" was 2 hours long, it didn't have to be."
"This intern could have done it's job in a sheer 90 minutes, but it stayed for not-needed overtime; and for that I can't highly recommend for you to hire ""The Intern"" into your movie watch company."
"It was a REALLY GOOD movie, a wholesome, not goofy/dirty/liberal trash heap."
It was just a good movie.
this is a film I liked it made me fell good and happy
"As long as you don't really pay attention to the plot, it's a nice movie."
When watching the previews I was reluctant to watch this film because I thought the only possible story line was the older intern would end up dying.
"This movie is nothing about that, instead it's adorable and probably one of my new favorite movies."
The ending is a little abrupt but overall I highly recommend it.
I actually enjoyed this movie.
"Robert Di Nero was fun, hilarious, and downright adorable."
"I have always loved Anne Hathaway, and I thought she was great in the film!"
The only part that annoyed me was the small husband cheating story.
"It was just a bit bland, and I don't think it added much to the movie!"
"I went in this during a 15 hour flight, not knowing anything about it, and I loved it."
"So much so that I watched it again with my wife after getting back, to confirm that it wasn't just the alcohol and Xanax that made me smile and cry basically through the entire movie, it actually is really charming."
And on second viewing I noticed a lot of little details that show a lot of attention went into it.
"Anne Hathaway is lovely, and it is *SO* refreshing to see Robert deNiro do anything other than his usual schtick, and pulling it off just fine."
Not bad for what is a somewhat typical 'fish out of water' trope & chick flick: this is one movie that does it really well.
"Didn't know much about this movie before I watched it, but it turned out to be very good."
The quality of acting by De niro brings you in and holds your interest.
Esta comedia americana demuestra la versatilidad de De Niro y pone a Hathaway en el √∫nico tipo de papel que interpreta bien.
A very well-made and sweet movie.
:-D
"A feel-good movie with endearing characters and a storyline that was convincing, engaging, and humorous enough to keep me hooked till the end."
"While it draws somewhat on stereotypes of both seniors and Millennials, the film presents the characters, especially Jules and Matt, as dimensional, if a little dramatized, people growing and learning in a fast-paced world."
"To me, the film captures what life feels like for younger adults in the job world--a little glamorous and exciting, but mostly hard and emotional."
Ben was a reliable and likable character.
I especially enjoyed the heartfelt scene where she learns to lean on him as a mentor.
"Overall, this movie doesn't leave a hugely strong impression, but it does leave one pleasant enough that I will happily recommend watching it."
Love this movie.
Would reccomend.
It's a great feel good movie.
"This is a perfectly enjoyable, low-stress watch that is driven by the surprising chemistry between DeNiro and Hathaway."
"I put it on in the background one night after The Ringer's Andy Greenwald mentioned it as a solid ""Plane Movie"" and I'm glad I did."
Grade: B
"Certainly doesn't take any risks or cover new territory, but like most other Nancy Meyers movies, if it comes on I will watch it all the way through."
There's something to be said for that.
How did this get good ratings?
"So slow,boring,ending sucked!!"
Horrible!!!
Much better than I anticipated!
Thought it would be a so so cheesy movie but I loved the characters.
The movie touched my heart a bit...
It lags and lacks but is ultimately watchable.
Well casted and directed with an array of interesting characters and situations which are not completely predictable.
A fun time.
"Funny, interesting, well-made film about a retiree who wants to get back into the work world and finds an internship assisting an entrepreneur who's overworked."
"It's very contemporary but a little deeper than a lot of these comedies with some interesting commentary on gender roles and a multi-dimensional female main character (even if she didn't make it into the title, ahem)."
"Every millennial should watch this flick, if only to take notes on Ben's (Robert De Niro's) old-fashioned charm, humble integrity, and stunning work ethic."
The movie itself is not great content wise...But the point at which i ended up seeing the movie made my day..Its your typical feel good movie...and i quite liked it.
It was a breath of fresh air to watch this movie...A typical feel good movie after which one gets a feeling that life is beautiful...and at the end of which one truly wishes that it was...
"Ben (Robert DeNiro): ""You're never wrong to do the right thing."""
"Jules (Anne Hathaway): Who said that, you?"
Ben (Robert DeNiro): Yeah.
But I'm pretty sure Mark Twain said it first.
"This was kind of cute, sort of a revese ""Devil Wears Prada"", but it lacks the quirkiness of Prada to make this film truly endearing."
"It tried just a little too hard to be likable and sort of missed the mark- the comical scenes weren't really all that funny, the serious parts seemed insincere."
Robert DeNiro (Ben Whittaker) was genuinely adorable though- probably one of his few characters you didn't to punch in the face.
The best parts of this film were Adam Devine (Jason) and Andrew Rannelis (Cameron).
"Overall, it's not a bad film, it has a good heart just not genuinely heart-warming."
The Intern teams up Deniro and Hathaway in a romantic comedy about a young boss of a fashion company that hires a 70 year old intern and how these two become best friends and confidants.
This is a great movie guys this is a good chick flick to watch with your lady.
Highly recommended the 12 year and above kid age group could watch this as well.
It is a tad long in duration but has a strong story about friendship love marriage and trying something new.
You get to see Deniro's lighter side in this movie.
Highly recommended.
"Ok, no Devil wears Prada, but fun."
Kind of a sappy buddy comedy of sorts.
"They unfortunately really play up the stereotypes of millennials as juvenile (well, mostly the men) and gender bias towards women in power."
I do like the way they gave De Niro's character a large range of situations and showed how valuable a senior can still be.
Light-hearted comedy.
Robert De Niro nailed it.
"Watchable, though far from spectacular."
"It won't floor you, but it won't bore you."
"While the story fails to live up to its premise, the chemistry between DeNiro and Hathaway is undeniable."
"good, but once was enough"
"In the end a far better film then I thought it would be, can not help thinking of De Niro as the tough guy (Ronin) but this is worth a watch, some sad lots of humour, happy ending?"
?
The Intern was absolutely wonderful!
I enjoyed every minute of this lovely jewel of a film.
"Robert De Niro was amazing, as was Anne Hathaway."
The entire cast was marvelous!
I highly recommend this film for all the sentimental hearts out there!
"A really lovely comedy drama about unusual friendship of an old intern (played by DeNiro), his boss (played by Hathaway), and his colleagues."
What is the core morale behind this?
What do they want to express?
In the end it is a series of unimportant and un-symbolic events to support a thin storyline about infidelity in a marrage.
"The ""eye blinking"" thing was obviously an impromptu add-on during filming but Roberto De Nino does make it looks funny."
I cannot give enough positive feedback for 'The Intern'.
De Niro gives a heartwarming performance as a senior citizen who decides to go back for an internship at a tech company.
"Along the way, the movie addresses topics like older values versus newer values, differences between generations, and how to have a useful attitude and be effective even when others are doubting you."
"The movie falls apart a bit in the third act because of the introduction of an unnecessary plot line, but overall, it's a strong movie that I tremendously enjoyed."
"Maybe I'm the one who is ""old school"" but these kind of roles just don""t work for De Niro, Martty needs a new mob flick."
A platonic office romance to keep you smiling and quite possibly welling up.
"Anne Hathaway could play a tree and deliver the performance of the year/ Even when she ugly cries, she's gorgeous."
How is that even possible?
"And alongside Robert De Niro, how can you go wrong?"
You can't.
A relatable story for office workers young and old alike.
4 handkerchiefs out of 5.
This movie was surprisingly real and entertaining.
It's not quite a rom-com.
I would describe it more as a feel-good movie.
The production quality was great.
The lighting and cinematography was appropriate and the costumes and set design was amazing.
The story was really well written and the cast really stepped up to the plate.
"The directing was obviously great, as all the actors totally became their characters."
You could identify with the story and it was funny.
"It was also incredibly sad at times and I even cried with the characters, but there was definitely more laughter and you walk away from the movie with some hope for the human race in general."
"If you just want to relax, but watch a movie with some substance this is definitely it."
I thought this was an excellent movie showing the usefulness and wisdom of an older generation and its relationship with the younger generations!
The Intern is about Robert Dinero trying to find a purpose in life after retirement.
"He enters an internship program at Anne Hathaway's company, where he becomes someone to lean on."
"The movie should have been called Lean On Me, because the movie was more about the day in the life of a CEO."
"Overall it was a good movie, very touching and sweet."
It was a good movie with a good cast.
The sweetest movie I've seen in a long time.
"Very nice movie, brought tears to my eyes."
Super acting by the entire cast.
Loved it.
Will definitely be watching it again.
"It's a bit schmaltzy and long, but The Intern overcomes it's faults with the chemistry of its two leads."
"misogynistic, condescending and simply not funny."
Hathaway's daddy issues send the wrong message to woman and girls and De Niro's character is nothing more than pandering to the older members of the Academy.
I loved it because it shows the young an the old together and yet the younger learning from the old.
6/17/16 HBO Cute film with predictable story line and dialogue.
"Relationships, having it all, elder wisdom, living life to the fullest, this has all the bases touched."
"In today's movie world with sex, violence, CGI images and ""adult language"", this is a fun, harmless easy going movie that makes you feel good."
Honestly it was the inverse of The Devil Wears Prada with not as much at stake.
Fun and sentimental non violent well acted movie
I love this one.
So warm.
Ben acted weird when he saw Matt was with someone else even Ben is 70.
Guess I don't have to be so nervous when that happened to me.
And I love Robert De Niro more after this movie ;)
The Intern was nothing like I expected it to be and that was a great thing.
"Not only did Robert De Niro play the cutest, sweetest old man in movie history but Anne Hathaway was actually enjoyable to watch and her character had a lot of shining moments."
Right from the start you can tell the film will have a lot of heart and it does in truckloads.
"The characters are all memorable and provide plenty of laughs and lots of sentimental, touching moments."
"The plot line was fun to follow and while bad things definitely happened, it was fantastic to see them play out and resolved in great ways."
This film really shows how keeping a positive attitude on life can really affect the lives of those around you and how one person can make a world of difference.
"This is a great family film, date night movie, whatever you want it to be it can be that, so I suggest you watch it and enjoy."
Watched on the plane going home ;)
A really nice enjoyable feel good movie with great chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway.
Didn't like the ending.
I don't even know how this movie has a single good review.
It is terrible.
Had potential but the unrealistic stupid crap that they wrote into the script ruins any chance this movie had to be good.
"Undeniable charming, undeniable enjoyable, and there is great chemistry between the two leads: Anne Hathaway, and Robert De Niro, who totally owns this film from the first scene."
"Usually these films are throwaways, but I make a prediction that 'The Intern' will be film to rank alongside 'Along Came Polly' and 'Four Weddings' in years to come."
The cheesiest cheese you ever choked on!!!!
The dialog feels like a disjointed mog-pog of greeting card oneliners.
"Cheerfully uplifting, intriguing and inspiring."
Anne and Robert make a great duo.
Delicately sweet & funny.
The Intern' won't give extreme belly laughs and is arguably overlong however it's enjoyable enough to not be bothered by those elements.
"Heartwarming,humorous."
"A little dull or off track in parts, but still stays in one piece."
"The movie is sweet, charming , and is over all well done .. Great cast & a good story - heart warming"
A waste of 2 hours.
Story drags on and on without any type of twists or suspenseful storyline.
Love DeNiro and Hathaway but this move was a really bad romantic comedy.
"Heart warming and life affirming, especially for those of us with a bit of age attached to us."
Our life lessons can help others if everyone is willing.
El Dinero no es la felicidad.
"Sino la amistad, y poder confiar en la gente."
El dinero no compra a la gente.
I thought for sure I'd dislike a 2 hr Hathaway movie.
It was pretty not bad.
"This one is decent, but not great."
"DeNiro is good and story fun, but script is weak and the film is too long for a comedy at 2hrs."
Worth a watch though.
"I loved this movie, I thought it was so cute."
I was a huge fan of the Devil Wears Prada and in this movie Anne Hathaway's character reminded me of Andy Sacs moving up and becoming like Miranda haha.
Robert Deniro was really good and this too it just worked well in my opinion it was sooo cute.
Your gonna love it <3
"I wanted to like it and i managed that; however, it raised questions like the intern was from a different industry not a different planet; he was perfectly suited to take some of the burden off of her, I'm not sure that ever came out."
"De Niro was fantastic as Ben Whittaker, known for roles that inquire intense performances, De Niro shows range as a mild mannered, emotionally in-tuned, borderline feminist."
The film was able to capture the new Brooklyn landscape without letting the Hipsterfication of neighborhoods like Park Slope get in the way of telling this odd-couple story.
Anders Holm and Adam Devine from Comedy Central's 'Workaholics' stand out in their supporting roles.
It was nice see them share the screen with a legend such as De Niro.
"Devine played true to his sophmoric character that he's most known for playing, whIle Holm took on a more serious and in depth role."
This movie pleasantly surprised me.
I was expecting a very clich√É¬©d romantic comedy that I'll forget as soon as the credits roll.
This movie is more than that.
De Niro gives a great performance and has excellent chemistry with Anne Hathaway.
The comedy is clever and the themes in this movie are very topical in today's world.
"My criticisms of this movie are some of the charcters are too perfect, some actors are underutilized, and some of the plot points are a tad clich√É¬©."
"This is a nice, fluffy movie that I recommend people check out"
"Veteran filmmaker Nancy Meyers, sure knows how to utilise her film's greatest asset -- the great Robert De Niro."
This is a movie that is missing something but makes up for it with a lot of charm.
Terrible.
Robert Deniro is totally undermined in this film and the writing is awful.
Good acting.
Fresh concept.
Probably one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
"Really good movie, it's not every day you find a good movie to see and enjoy."
TRULY ENJOYABLE-NOT MANY MOVIES ARE THIS PLEASURABLE TO WATCH.
"Funny, emotional, and real"
"Great movie, must watch."
Tries desperately to be feminist only to subvert its own message by having women in powerful positions crying on screen and diverting to the opinions of an old white man instead of their own.
The founding boss of an internet clothing company looks for a CEO to take over to give domestic life some relief & is saved by a retired executive senior intern.
Keeping up with corporate success can take its toll on the best of personal relations in the best of times.
But she toughs it out & everybody reconciles to the demands of running a successful business in the end.
Capitalist feminism triumphs after all.
A really good movie.
Solid performances across the board!!
First movie that has held my attention in a while!
Loved seeing the friendship blossom between the senior intern and young ceo.
the equivalent of watching a bland cialis add.
Interesting premise.
"Entertaining at first, but goes on far too long and falls apart near the end."
De Niro is great.
Hathaway... not so much.
Great cast.
Watched it twice the same day.
Once by myself and again with roommate.
Just what I needed tonight.
"Congrats you just joined ""As good as it gets"" and ""Something gotta give"" in my feel good movie marathon."
"This movie was refreshing in that rather than having romance or action as the main story line, the main story line was simply friendship, which doesn't often happen in a very substantial way anymore."
I guess for me this movie especially struck a chord because I am a CEO under 40 with a child.
I could relate to Jules character and DeNiro was a believable and unexpected great mentor.
I love how Jules honored his opinion after getting over the initial shock.
It is about as charming of a film as I have seen in years.
7/10.
"Not a huge fan of the ending, but liked it overall."
What an unexpected joy!
"Hard to believe that the guy who played Vito Corleone, The Taxi Driver, The Raging Bull, etc."
"could play such a charming, fatherly, laid-back role.After a few ""stinkers,"" DeNiro once again proved what a great actor he is!!"
This would have been a one star from me but at least the acting is good.
"This is a movie that seems to be trying to sell me a feminist message....by having the female CEO have no idea what she's doing, fall apart continually, and seek the help and guidance of the old white guy she's forced to team up with."
"I understand what the movie was TRYING to do, but boy did it fail."
It failed hard.
And on top of that?
It's boring as hell.
Caught on HBO.
Wasn't the WORST movie I've seen lately.
Good feel good movie.
It was okay.
Acting from both leads was very good.
The daughter wasn't good.
The writing wasn't great at some parts.
It was easy to really like De Niro's character.
It felt a little long.
Okay.
"Don't know why it cost $35,000 to make."
"A nice, quiet film that doesn't need much of an attention span to follow its cliche story-line."
I still enjoyed it and was fully engaged.
Soars on the chemistry between DeNiro and Hathaway.
Good movie.
This is something that happens in today's world.
They bring home a few points about our current generation of college graduates that we should all be taking heed to.
Good morals are developed throughout and it is all put together rather nicely.
"A very tender ""The Devil Wears Prada."""
I think I may be falling for Hathaway again.
You can't go wrong with Robert De'nerio and the movie is funny and has a great concept but there is something missing.
It's like they just went through the motions when creating this film.
But def hire it.
"The Intern ""Experience never gets old"" and his name is Robert De Niro"
Pretty underwhelming.
"It was okay, but at two hours, wears it's welcome out and has an extremely abrupt ending."
I hated the husband twist and I didn't think either of them were convincing as parents to a child that old.
"At lest it wasn't completely predictable, but once was enough watching this."
I had low expectations for this film.
I actually got it in order to hate-watch it.
"However, this movie was pretty charming."
"There's lots of obvious jokes ala, old people still use watches and calculators lolololol and, millennials are so casual in the work place lolololol."
"But, there are lots of meaningful moments and the movie is entertaining."
Who would have thought that Romantic Comedy star Anne Hathaway would ever be acting alongside Gangster Film star Robert De Niro?
"""The Intern"" stars both of them respectively and say what you will about sappy plots like this, ""The Intern"" is a very, very good film about life in general."
"Following a widower as he tries to keep himself busy on a daily basis, not matter what it is, Ben (De Niro) is hired as a senior personal-intern to Jules (Hathaway) at an online fashion website."
"Fitting right in as he had a very long career in business, they form an offbeat friendship that nobody would have expected."
"This film truly is about friendship, family, and life in general."
That is the main focus and it handles it wonderfully.
"Giving needed life lessons to the new/younger generation, while still caring about it's older audience, this film balances the old and the new in such an interesting way."
"Having a young family who clearly doesn't see their father's very much, Ben becomes that figure in their lives and changes it drastically, for better or worse."
Everything about this film moves at a very solid pace and you feel like it is giving you a slice of life at this moment in their lives.
"Where this film falters, is the choices made by some of the characters in the final act."
It began to feel a little less like life itself and more like a movie when decisions being made felt like plot devices in order to have the happy/sad ending that it went for.
"It tries very hard to pull on your heart strings and I did not buy into the emotional impact of the final few scenes as the decisions felt very forced, in my opinion at least."
"I did not believe that this particular conclusion would have happened in reality, and while the film played out as a very realistic picture, that shift in tone was jarring to me."
"""The Intern"" does benefit from an experience writer in this genre, which is why most of the film is so great."
"Nancy Meyers writes and directs this film, and while her earlier films such as ""Father of the Bride, The Parent Trap, or ""The Holiday"" have all been enjoyable, films later in her career such as ""Father of the Bride 2"" or ""It's Complicated"" really hurt her pedestal."
"Thankfully, this film has put Meyers back in the spotlight and I look forward to see more of her work in the future."
"With all the right feel good moments, compelling character developing scenes, and the perfect amount of levity between young and old characters, ""The Intern"" is a far better movie than it should be and I highly recommend it."
Very solid entertainment.
"Nancy Meyers, not many people do it better."
"Comedy, pretty people, relationship problems, deep thinking and everything will be just fine in the end, or even better than fine."
"nice diversion, some good laughs too."
"Robert De Niro should do more comedy, he is actually great in it!"
Having wanted to see this movie last year but being unable to due to a busy schedule at the time.
I'm currently disappointed as I wasn't able to make the time to see this movie sooner.
In this pleasant feel good movie Robert De Niro plays the role of Ben Whittaker a 70 year old retired widower.
"After having grown tired of the monotonous life of being retired, seemingly to lack any challenge or purpose."
Ben applies for an internship as a senior citizen for an online fashion retailer.
It is here that De Niro is assigned to aid the highly stressed and frenetic female entrepreneur Jane Ostin (Anne Hathaway).
The chemistry between these two characters is amazing.
De Niro astoundeds and leaves the audience yearning for more as his old school charm shines through in this character.
Hathaway also charms and creates a compelling performance.
This movie deals with how older citizens are often overlooked in society despite their wealth of knowledge and experience.
While also showing how women are often discriminated against when they value their career over a traditional role in the family.
"There's a really cool plot device that Nancy Meyers uses to show this, that I'll avoid spoiling."
But I found it really awesome.
But at the same time the movie try's to foster a sense of masculinity and gentry that De Niro's character (and I sense De Niro himself) feels has eroded and faded with the rise of the modern man.
Overall this movie is not without its flaws.
There are points in the story that frustrate and annoy.
While at points being a bit thin on substance.
But the charm of Hathaway and De Niro and the chemistry between them creates great moments that will leave you in a good mood.
"At its heart that's what this movie is, a feel good production that will boost your mood for the next day or week."
"While doing it with charm, class and style at every turn of the way."
Pop publications have pondered what makes Anne Hathaway so annoying.
"She's a perfectly beautiful and talented actress, but there's something about her that just smacks of trying too hard."
"Why the public prefers cool, calculated nonchalance over effusive ambition to please is an argument (perhaps loaded with gender politics) for another day, but suffice it to say, Anne Hathaway is a little bit annoying in this movie."
"She tries to be cool and calculated, as per Jules, her character - a self-made internet entrepreneur - but when Jules meets the titular intern, Ben, and lets that bosswoman exterior fall and starts hanging out with her dopey underlings, Hathaway (not the character) tries to be ""one of the boys"" and the performance fails."
"Her buzzed rant lamenting the manboys' sloppy workplace attire rings false, trite, whiney, and patriarchal."
That may also be the script's fault for creating a flat gentleman hero of yore to act as Jules's foil and to be put on a pedestal as the classic man all men should strive to be.
"For a movie about a woman in a man's world, written and directed by a woman, it defaults to the crutch of ""behind every great woman is a greater-yet-not-flashy-about-it man who allows her to blossom into the powerful, great woman she has the potential to be."""
It just happens to be cute because Ben is thirty years her senior and is more a father figure than a romantic interest.
"Regardless, this movie is like the Anne Hathaway conundrum."
It's cute but annoying.
"It has the potential to challenge the incessant questions kick-butt actresses and female CEOs are asked about balancing home and work, but it doesn't."
"It has the potential to question why go-getting women like Anne Hathaway are thought of as annoying or fake, but it doesn't."
Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway star in the funny and touching comedy The Intern.
"Directed by Nancy Meyers, the film follows a retiree who applies for a senior internship with an internet upstart company and gets partnered with the company's overworked and controlling president."
De Niro gives an excellent performance that has a lot of nuance and charm to it.
And the writing is rather clever in its commentary on the modern workplace.
"However, the film's feminist agenda causes some problems; as it ignores the Hathaway character's neglect and mistreatment of her family and that her managerial style has hampered the growth of her employees."
"Yet despite some mixed messaging, The Intern is entertaining and fun."
"Feel good movie but I must say the performances are better than the film itself some parts of the film felt forced, but overall it's good surface of life movie"
Best movie I have seen in a long time.
"Well, if it's the only thing on, it's okay."
Movie went above expectations.
Good rom com that both men and women can enjoy.

"70-year-old widower Ben (Robert De Niro) becomes a senior intern at an online fashion site, founded and run by Jules (Anne Hathaway) in a surprisingly quite lovely."
"Although feel-good, its ending is practical."
"De Niro is the perfect gentlemen and makes the movie, with good on-screen chemistry with Hathaway."
dinero really saved anything to be said about this one
Prijemna pohodovka.
Stoji za zhlidnuti.
Hathaway and De Niro forms a formidable chemistry.
Good to see a movie not gender stereotyping a successful female entrepreneur.
The rom-com tone is a bit out of place at times.
Quirky and just far enough south of cheesy to stay enjoyable.
"The two leads are fantastic together and in spite of lost opportunities to turn this into something deeper, it remains an enjoyable, feel good movie."
DE NIRO & HATHAWAY-Can't beat it!
And I WANT to BE Renee Russo!
Loved the acting and story line!
Excellent!
"more movies should bring this level of acting, humor and still be family friendly."
"I watched this movie last night with my girlfriend (who is a film major), and she loved this one."
I'm not sure what this movie was trying to achieve.
"I suppose more than anything it could be classified as an emotion film, but it goes about evoking it in the wrong way."
"Robert DeNiro portrays the confident, hard working Ben Whittaker."
"Now in his 70's, he's retired and widowed, and in the position of having too much time on his hands."
His life is stagnant and he doesn't really know what to do with himself anymore.
"Enter Jules Ostin (Ann Hathaway), successful, confident entrepreneur running a multi-million dollar website/ clothing company."
"A savvy-minded person, summarized easily as a successful hipster with too much on her plate."
"Her company, also full of hipsters with less acumen put out an advert for a 'senior-intern' or rather an old person for the office work to make them feel useful."
"Ben responds, gets the job, and becomes close friends with the boss."
What I didn't enjoy about this movie was the over the top scenes that were just notably devoid of the proper emotional content.
"Ben becomes her confidant, best friend, and business partner in a few ways."
The connection between the two is supposed to be one of friendship and understanding.
But on screen it seems like nothing built up to that moment.
"One minute they are strangers, in the next moment best friends, missing any real emotional built up."
"Jules husband, a kind of out of shape former businessman, doesn't seem to care about his wife in his most emotional scene."
"It was watching an actor trying to cry really really hard, and I couldn't connect at all."
Not to mention Anne Hathaway's response is the most inappropriate garbage I've ever seen.
I know people who react stronger when the girl at Starbucks get's their order wrong!
"The rest of the dialogue consists of clich√© after clich√©, and I got bored after about 5 minutes after he starts his internship."
"Personally it was nice to see DeNiro in his old age, acting as a sweet and lovable guy."
It shows a real range in acting from his youth.
A man who has been in the film industry this long deserves credit for carrying this thinly veiled attempt to make a quick buck from those of you looking for a movie to see on date night.
"Sorry guys, but be prepared to snooze."
1.5/5
A good movie for 40 years old ladies
Very cute movie with great acting.
"Si hay Robert De Niro, estamos siempre bien."
#Pel√≠culasEnLosAviones
I really was liking this right up until the point where it got stupid.
De Niro is great as always.
A great feel good movie that is becoming seemingly more rare as the years go on.
"This movie tugged on my heart, and brought a smile to my face."
"It a pleasure to watch a fun movie with one ""F"" word."
"As far as basic comedies go, this is one of the better ones."
Cute and delightful movie.
"It was nice not to be scared, disgusted or terrorized while watching a movie."
Just as conventional as you'd expect Robert De Niro doing movies of this sort these days.
There's nothing to say about this film as it's one big safe commercial more than anything thought-provoking.
I'll give it props for letting Adam Devine to use his comedic talent naturally in the scenes he's given.
Fun and emotional sorry if how one mans life can influence someone else's.
Very entertaining and a positive film for Hathaway.
The understated De Niro is best.
"This charming but sad look at the reality of a dying breed known as the gentleman works because I think our culture is starving for decency, competence, and unapologetic masculinity."
"Once the great men are all gone will we only be left with ""micro-agressions"", ""safe spaces"", and skinny jeans?"
My hope is that we tire of fad-driven slobbishness and handkerchief sales go through the roof.
An enjoyable easy going film
Unexpectedly wonderful!
You're never wrong to the Right thing.
"Earnest performances from its talented cast manages to keep this mushy clich√©d story afloat, but with its 120+ mins runtime - it definitely overstays its welcome."
"Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) is retired, widowed and restless."
He joins an online fashion startup founded and run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) as a senior intern and quickly make friends with his old school charm and his caring nature.
"While Jules isn't initially kicked about the senior internship program, she quickly finds a friend and a mentor in Ben who helps her make decisions personally and professionally."
"Nancy Meyers is quite experienced in this genre which is a double edged sword - while she handles it with a template old-school narrative, she also induces enough clarity and confidence that helps in the overall experience."
"Problem with actors like De Niro is that they have such strong histrionics, its hard to see them in character and this is where he is a revelation here breaking away from that with an earnest performance."
He even uses his trademark scowl with a very different result.
Anne Hathaway also does a very good job but it is something very similar to what she has done in 'Devil wears Prada' or 'Princess Diaries'.
The rest of the cast if I am being too critical would say are a bunch of stereotypes stuck in clich√©d scenarios.
"While it says some right things about the ecommerce startup industry, it is too muddled and superficial in depicting it on screen."
A good movie option for a date night if you can absorb the unusual chemistry between its leads who are in top form.
"Would recommend this movie any day, any time."
Just love the great acting and if its POSSIBLE A PART TWO WOULD BE AMAZING.
Words can not express my love for this movie.
"Absolutely, loved this movie!!!"
Many dimensions and a unlikely friendship.
Better than I'd imagined but nothing more than a basic chick-flick
Entertaining and unique.
Great entertaining movie.
Had a lot of heart in it.
Great actors.
"It's a light comedy, it's not really funny at all."
"Just a clean light non hostel movie, i found it boring to be honest, glad i didn't spend the money in the theater but DVD."
I personally wouldn't rent it unless you support expensive actors like Annie Hathaway stealing money from all the people behind the set getting minimum wage vice versa.
Good feel good movie
"I half expected a cheesy movie, very watchable."
"And it meets my expectations :) Ah but if you look carefully, this movie is quite deep, and on so many levels."
Nice to see De Niro taking it easy in retirement.
"By no means a bad film, though a few bits weren't really needed."
I would have given this a higher rating of the ending wasnt so god awful.
A film so featherlite and desperate to be liked it floats away into nothingness after fifteen minutes.
"As it turns out, Ben (Dr Niro) has something to not only teach the various members of the company about how to run a company, but he brings a wealth of knowledge to the individual players' personal lives themselves, assisting each of the ""youngsters"" in the fashion in which they each live their lives as he touches them while he weaves his way through their daily lives."
"In short, this film is not only entertaining, it actually offers a life lesion that we all could stand to learn."
http://hubpages.com/entertainment/A-different-kind-of-intern-for-a-new-generation
a light positive joyful movie about how it's never too late.
Reminder of how new energy and mature experience are essential for a workplace to prosper.
"Fun movie, little painful in parts but overall a good balance for a his and hers"
Very sad to se Deniro go out like this.
it wasn't too bad of a movie but I think it played out pretty slowly and it definitely had a lesson I didn't care about embedded into it.
"I truly was hoping to have Deniro kill someone or at the very least make them feel afraid for their lives, but there was none of that and I barely wanted to fuck Anne Hathaway in this movie, so that was disappointing."
This movie is an enjoyable romantic comedy.
Nice to see De Niro play a character that has a little bit of depth as opposed to a couple of his recent roles.
Anne Hathaway plays the high pressure successful alpha female role quite well but doesn't soar to any great heights as her character's interactions are just a little shallow.
"Easy to watch film, there is no pressure as it all works out in the end for the best..........."
Most enjoyable feel good movie.
RD was really good.
LOVE Robert Deniro in this movie!
very cute and predictable movie.
didn't think the ending was that great though.
"When I was a boy De Niro made movies like Goodfellas, Casino, Heat."
"Now it's Fockers, Bad Grandpa and this steaming big pile of monkey shit."
Sweet and unassuming
A heartwarming-style comedy drama.
A man finds his true passion after his retirement from a phonebook printing company despite his passed-away wife included.
"Finding out how stressful his female boss can get, he does what he can do to stabilize her, with his older age thus his longer life experience."
"While there was certainly a least an average amount of laughter, I would consider this more of a drama (a nice one in fact)."
"There was certainly a lot of hype during the e-mail crisis scene, thus making the film more interesting and almost forcing people to pay attention to it again if ever the problem."
It's basically a satisfying relaxing comedy with a catching plot.
Fairly decent overall.
A cute and simple story that was kinda sad.
De Niro and Hathaway killed it!!
"Great charm, great story, and respectable outcome."
"Alright, let's be honest - there was some huge pandering to the millenials (and even centennials) here ... and I'm totally fine with that, because I am that audience."
Does this rely too much on stereotypes without poking enough fun at them?
"Oh, yes."
But is it quirky and charming (Hathaway is simply quaint) and sentimental?
"It ends a bit abruptly, but nicely, with a symbolic change in pace for Hathaway's character."
Much better than I expected.
A nice feel-good flick to chill out with on an uneventful weekend.
"The story is beyond predictable, it's actually a little meh."
But there are some funny instances in the plot and both De Niro and Hathaway are great.
I finally got to see this movie and loved it.
Robert De Niro is the guy everybody didn't know they really needed in their life.
"And Anne Hathaway is brilliant as the mom who is just trying to have it all, but is hitting serious bumps along the way."
I won't spoil it for you and tell you the ending; but I laughed and cried during this movie.
Boring slow and predictable
"Not your conventional feel good movie, really liked the premise and pacing and chemistry between AH and RD and but ending w him as still intern and not a VP or COO is ridiculous."
The Intern is honestly nothing more than a lighthearted comedy.
And that's a compliment considering my personal opinion in the genre.
"With profound leads like Deniro and Hathaway, there's an extra factor of quality that makes this movie plausible and enjoyable."
super cute.
deniro is basically the hip grandpa that everyone wants to chill with
Good chemistry with Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway about a company owner (Hathaway) who reluctantly hires an Intern with a twist (DeNiro) who is 75.
Some warm moments and comedic pleasures make this enough to watch
"at 60% i thought this movie would be a good watch with my wife, something i could tolerate that she'd enjoy."
but this induced laughs when it seemed to be trying to be sincere... it was so completely contrived.
Actually pretty funny!
"""I still have music in me, absolutely positive about that!"""
The story just ends and completely wastes its talented leads.
"They're both likable characters, which makes the movie enjoyable until late in the film when it just completely runs out of steam, instead opting for an awful, awful message."
As safe as they come.
So this is about a widower (Robert De Niro).
"Looking to fill the void in his life, he applies and gets into an internship program for an upstart online fashion company run by a young entrepreneur (Anne Hathaway)."
"Will there relationship start off rocky, but steadily improve?"
Will they learn a life lesson or two from each other along the way?
It has been a while since I saw a Robert De Niro movie that I legitimately liked.
"Looking at his film library, this goes all the way back to Silver Linings Playbook, a film that he is not even a lead in."
"But hey, everybody approaches their twilight years differently, especially when it comes to a career in acting, and with The Intern, I can at the very least say he has a role that he is having a lot of fun with."
"While I did actually like this, make no mistake: there are very few surprises to be had, and I knew exactly where this was going from the opening 10 minutes."
"The Intern is a very typical fish out of water story, and it is totally something that you can and probably should take your parents to."
"There's not a lot of conflict, all the characters learn a life lesson, and everybody walks away feeling reasonably good about themselves."
"You know that Robert De Niro is going to have trouble operating e-mails on his computer, and you know that what Hathaway has in success, she's lacking in experience."
"You've seen this movie before, and I promise you that you posses the ability to map this out with very little difficulty."
"The Intern is light, and surprisingly, it's not all that different from 2013's The Internship."
"I don't think this needed to be a full 2 hours long; it could have 20 minutes shaved off easy, and it would have been a better movie for it."
"De Niro sells it, and he and Hathaway look like they had a great time together, because I am sure that they did."
"It's very standard odd couple story, and I was able to have fun with it, mostly because of how the actors played it."
"I don't think it is as good as Nancy Meyer's It's Complicated, but it's a movie that I found to be difficult to hate."
"Idomi ideja, bet daugiau nieko idomaus."
"Cute movie, but frustrating."
Really good and very funny
it had been a long time since I have seen a great movie but tonight Larry and I were not disappointed with this film.
"Robert Di Nero and Ann Hathaway did a great job, it had romance, comedy and drama."
it is well written and acted.
"it is a ""feel good"" sort of film."
"No pod√É¬≠a dejar de verla, sencillamente divina."
√Ç¬°Me encant√É¬≥!
I love De Niro and Hathaway in just about anything they do.
"Its thin story with a few cliches, but there is also a twist or two."
"Ignoring all that though, its leads are just so damn likeable and work so brilliantly together that any flaws are lost in the sheer enjoyment of watching them."
"Its fun, its silly, its a good way to waste a couple hours... Resonant Line: ""Ben: I still have music in me, absolutely positive about that!"""
"I feel guilty for liking this movie, but I did."
"It was very cute, and a nice way to spend 2 hours on a plane or with Netflix."
Excellent.
Worth watching.
A cute comedy with good acting and some touching moments
Excellent flick to watch after a day of hard work but no real substance.
"A sweet, charming comedy with great chemistry between De Niro & Hathaway."
[7/10]
"A fun movie, but was this produced by AARP?"
Both DeNiro and Hathaway are outstanding and there's a lot to love.
"Thanks largely to performances by De Niro and Hathaway, It's UpLifting"
Funny & heart warming!
Pulls at your heart strings just enough.
Great movie about respect our elders and the past still has a lot to offer in this hanging world.
Refreshing and a good reminder to slow down.
A great film which is well thought out
65% Saw this on 8/3/16 Terrific acting from Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway can't salvage the film from its fucking cliched feel good routes nor from the boring girlish Devil Wears Prada routes.
"The film does have a lot of its moments and some fast pacing, but every time the film focuses on dresses and cosmetics, it hits rock bottom."
"The leads have terrific chemistry, but the overly treacly ending is an eyesore."
"The ""sexual inneudo"" is not necessary and did not add to the movie!"
Great movie other than that.
"Audiences want ""hope"", the private areas of life or the base behavior does not give hope to anyone."
Anne Hathaway had starred in a movie where she had topless scenes etc.
"that was ""rotten tomato"" this one was the Anne I had grown to love through the Disney movies."
great family clean movie.
Heart-warming and well-written script!
Nobody uses the music score the way Nancy Meyers does.
De Niro at his very best.
Quite impressed by Anne Hathaway too.
Not bad thought it was going to be more of a comedy.
"Review: I must be getting soppy in my old age, because I actually enjoyed this movie."
I know that it's extremely corny and the storyline is predictable but I found the movie sweet and DeNiro was great as the perfect gentleman.
"After playing the bullied victim in the Devil Wears Praia, Anne Hathaway (Jules) has gone full circle, in this movie, by running her own company whilst trying to be a mother to her young girl, Paige and a wife to her husband, who is having an affair."
"I liked Robert DeNiro's character, Ben Whittaker because I always wondered how it must be for the elderly, who have lost there spouse, and stuck indoors with nothing to do."
"Although this isn't a true story, I loved his ""get up and go"" attitude and the fact that he was willing to do anything to keep busy."
"Its been a long time since I have seen a film were the young have respect for there elders, which is how I was brought up, so I have to commend the director for not playing on the age aspect to much."
"The chemistry between Hathaway and DeNiro was also great and the fact that he knew what to say at the right time, without offending anyone, made his character unique and extremely sweet."
The whole cheating husband element of the film didn't go overboard and I liked the way that Ben handled the tricky situation.
"Anyway, I enjoyed the movie and I'm not surprised that it made such a profit."
Enjoyable!
"Round-Up: This movie was written and directed by Nancy Meyers, 66, who brought you the Parent Trap in 1998, the funny What Women Want, with Mel Gibson, Something's Gotta Give, with the great Jack Nicholson, the Holiday and It's Complicated, with Meryl Streep."
"Judging by her previous projects, she is obviously a master in the Rom-Com department and she has worked with some top actors, who put in great performances in her movies."
She also makes original movies and introduces different elements so they're not a straight lace romantic comedies.
"Although this movie doesn't have any romance at all, the relationship between the two main characters is still quite emotional, even though they come from two completely different world's."
"Anyway, this is definitely worth a watch, just to see DeNiro in a different light and it's good to see that a 70 year old man can fit into today's world of technology and offer his lifetime experience to the youngsters."
"Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $200million I recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies starring Robert DeNiro, Anne Hathaway, Rene Russom Anders Holm, Zack Pearlman and Adam DeVine."
2024-07-10 00:00:00
Lets be honest here...This movie is exactly how you expect it will be..
"So, if your one for plot twists and a ""roller-coaster"" style movie scripts, this one isn't for you."
BUT!
"don't ride this movie off.. Its a ""feel-good"" movie with great performances from the staring roles which leaves you feeling happy and delighted with your movie choice."
Great for people looking for a movie that will entertain the whole family and will leave everyone smiling by the end.
I loved this movie.
It was so wonderful to watch Robert DeNero and Anne Hathaway share this lovely movie.
The supporting cast are a delight too.
I totally enjoyed this fun and heart filled movie from beginning to end.
Get Redbox film for the weekend
Heart melting fantastic film
03.05.2016: Kinda Cute in a way
"What starts out as a funny lighthearted, cute comedy has a more emotional tone to it later on in the film."
"It has great performances all around, and very few flaws except for the slow pace that makes the movie feel longer than it needs to be."
"Best movie I've seen in theaters in a long, long time!!!"
Anne Hathaway and Robert de Niro are magical when put together in a movie!
"This was hilarious, and heart warming!"
After the movie was finished both my husband and I said we didn't want it to end and wanted to know what happened after!
this is a movie you could watch over and over!
A movie looking through the eyes of Robert de Niro as an intern is better than one might think.
predictable but heartwarming
"Kyll√§ oli ihan vitun l√§mminhenkinen, pitk√§ ja tyls√§ elokuva."
"Refreshing, lighthearted, and surprisingly funnier than I imagined it to be."
Good drama and cute story http://rendumukkallo.blogspot.com/2016/02/the-intern.html
Cute but predictable.
Typical feel good drama.
Anne Hathaway has its way to make u joy and sad after in just seconds.
Robert De Niro did agood job but its not his perfect.
the idea of the film that experience never get old is is acause am glade to defend about it any time so its great for me.
the movie is funny and dramatic and i said anne hathaway is great before?!
A fun comedy that really works because of the chemistry of the two leads.
A really strong film that I recommend.
At its surface there isn't anything new about this Nancy Meyers helmed film.
"There's the figurehead of the strong, difficult, woman in charge, and the comparative, mature, father figure."
"There's fashion, sexual politics, and the beauty of Brooklyn brownstones but not a lot else."
Robert De Niro is the eponymous intern who has nothing better to do than work in a senior program after being a company man much of his life.
"Widowed and without much to do, he becomes indispensable to a harried woman trying to run her own company in the midst of chaos both professionally and domestically."
"I buy that Ben (De Niro) is a professional, and someone with a bit of class, but it never becomes clear how he is so affable and sensitive to the trappings of Hathaway's character."
The plot occasionally suffers because Ben isn't a fully thought out character.
"He tells people to be truthful, but then breaks into a house rather than have Jules (Hathaway) talk to her mother."
He tells his co-workers to be polite and treat women with respect and then watches one of them use an emotional moment for leverage in woo-ing a female co-worker.
The plot ricochets around without truly understanding its characters and the ending feels a little anticlimactic because of it.
"The central conflict doesn't come until near the end, and there's so central villain or antagonist to the film."
"Most of the conflict comes from Jules' marriage, and that just shouldn't be the central premise of a film in this day and age, especially when it's tacked on at the end."
If there was a better conflict this could have been a more heartfelt film.
Much better than I thought it was going to be.
"I was worried it was a click flix, but i was actually very well done and a little outside the box."
It flirted around the edge of a good experience but De Niro play the old guy like he had one foot in the grave.
The one good twist didn't show until mid way through the movie and not fully developed.
His business background was in another industry not a different planet.
"Alleviivaavaa perush√∂mpp√§√§, mutta jotenkin ihana."
Hyv√§ntahtoinen.
Ja -tuulinen.
"Lentokoneen meteliss√§ meni tekstitt√§m√§tt√∂m√§st√§ leffasta varmaan osa ohi, mutta elokuva oli sen verran kliseinen, ett√§ pelk√§st√§√§n kuvaa katsomalla ymm√§rsi, mit√§ kohtauksell haettiin."
"En oikein tied√§ oliko kohderyhm√§ leffalle el√§kel√§iset, vai nuoremmat, mutta ainakin vitsi√§ v√§√§nnettiin vanhan sed√§n some-osaamattomuudesta ja muusta fossiiliudesta."
"Anne Hathawayn hahmo oli hieman √§rsytt√§v√§ uraohjus, jonka el√§m√§n Robert de Niron esitt√§m√§ set√§hahmo tulee laittamaan mallilleen."
Samalla saadaan itse set√§kin tyytyv√§iseksi.
"Kliseista, alleviivaavaa Hollywood-komediaa, mutta sopi hyvin v√§syneen√§ lentokoneessa katsottavaksi."
Just finished.
Really enjoyed this movie.
Wish it would have been able to go on even longer.
Great characters.
Throws every emotional turd at the wall to see what sticks.
Talented cast members glue a few of those dookies that would have otherwise slid to the floor.
"Good movie, Robert Dinero, and Ann Hathaway, do good job in this simple comedy."
"I enjoyed this flick, De Niro was excellent and its was a fun movie to watch."
Well worth a cheesy watch.
Far better than most rom-coms and a far better feminist comedy than the tripe that was Trainwreck.
This movie is such a great movie!
"It's a true ""feel good"" movie."
"It Keeps you entertained and is made really, very well."
The small details they used in the scenery & in the props is truly great.
The chemistry between Robert De Niro & Anne Hathaway is undeniable and makes you wanna be friends with them.
It was a great movie!!
love the acting of Robert De Niro & Anne hatchway they just worked together wonderfully.
i would see it again.
The story was building but the ending was totally lame.
I liked it pretty much until the ending left you wondering if they ran out of money to write a decent end to the script!
An earnest and gentle film that's very pleasant to watch.
"It reminds you that regardless of how overwhelming life may sometimes be, it's important to take a step back and appreciate both the people and things around you."
"It's the type of film that makes you feel so warm inside, that you just want to go out and cheer up anyone who is feeling down."
"With De Niro and Hathaway in lead roles, I have nothing but good things to say about this movie."
I absolutely loved it!
for a hectic Friday night with nothing else to do this film fit the bill.
"DeNiro and Hathaway have an unusual chemistry that seems to work, despite the fact the story is somewhat light."
When I set out to watch The Intern I expected charm and some laughs but what I got instead was charm and soul.
The thought of Robert De Niro playing a retired widower would have seemed ridiculous 25 year ago but he plays the role so well that you forget his gangster ridden past to enjoy his moving insight.
De Niro and Anne Hathaway play off each other like old friends and it was a refreshing take on a high strung boss who takes herself too seriously while her underlings clamor for the corners.
It was a thoughtful and delightful film to be sure and it harkens back multiple times to Ms. Hathaway's star turn in The Devil Wears Prada.
"A truly enjoyable film to be sure, so grab the popcorn and relax because this film is in the hands of two veterans."
I really enjoyed this movie.
Hathaway and De Niro worked well together.
"It was a nice, sweet movie."
A role well essayed by Robert De Niro.
"It's a movie which fits in the current scenario very well, about the role of women in today's scenario?"
"Is she a mother, a office going colleague, or someone who is able to balance both successfully, which is rare."
"The dialogues were pretty good; Robert De Niro, as Ben Whittaker is not preachy at all, yet he sends his message across to both the men and women alike."
"As the tagline says, ""Experience never gets old."""
and I personally should respect it.
It had a moral in it too.
So all in all a job well done by all the people involved.
Cheers!
A sweetly entertaining film with a better than average late period performance from De Niro.
"Personally to me, this is De Niro's most charming and heartwarming role yet."
The chemistry between him and Hathaway just feels so natural.
The great message of bridging of the generation gap is one that is very timely indeed.
deniro and hathaway carry this otherwise bland story
Great movie.... Until the ending!
Really wanted to have something that concluded it more than what was shown.
"Charming movie for adults who enjoy good acting, great cast, and excellent script."
De Niro has one of his better recent rolls with an understated character that nevertheless shows a 70 year old senior can make a great contribution to a young web based start up by just being a calming voice in the storm.
Anne Hathaway is brilliant as always as the CEO who is overwhelmed by job and family.
You'll find the pace of the movie is somewhat slower than many but it has it's action and humor moments.
I hope De Niro can find more rolls like this in his golden years.
with a few laughs and good heart this movie is mainly carried by Anne Hathaways acting its worth a watch if your bored but its nothing I would go out of my way to watch
"A simple light hearted movie, good to watch."
First rate performances by Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway.
"Clever, cute, and fun, with some realism/drama thrown in for good measure."
This movie could even inspire guys getting back to the era of being gentlemen.
Who knows!
Rating: 7 / 10
Cute and enjoyable.
I didn't get a chance to see it in the theater but it was fine to see it at home.
I love DeNiro so I had to see it.
Not a bad rent at all.
Deniro/Hathaway are a really good pair.
Another film you get like you've seen before but really enjoyed it throughout the film.
"Agradable comedia familiar en la que Robert De Niro vuelve a demostrar que puede ser un grand√≠simo actor con amplios registros, haciendo sombra incluso a una gran actriz como Anne Hathaway."
"Es posible que algunos momentos la trama peque de demasiado edulcorada, y se acerca peligrosamente a ser una pel√≠cula no demasiado feminista...bala que consigue esquivar alej√°ndose del t√≥pico, tan americano, de que ""la familia es lo primero"" (especialmente si eres mujer)."
Muy recomendable.
The intern.
A novel twist on the normal post graduate intern ship within high rise companies.
Ben Whittaker (de niro) is a retired widow looking and longing for something to fill in his days.
After seeing an advert for an intern ship for the over 65's he took the plunge and got the job.
After adapting to the role he fits right in and his mentor is none other than Jule Ostin (hathaway).
Delving deep into personal life of Jules there is much to see and help with and the pair build up a friendship.
Lovely fun comedy movie.
Cute and lovable movie.
I really enjoyed it!
"Quick pace, never wished it was over or thought it was too long."
"Acting was good, I want to be like Deniro's character even though I'm 45 years younger!"
The plot fairly guessable but it was definitely a feel good movie and nothing was really aggravating like when they make it wicked depressing.
I would recommend!
I absolutely loved this movie...It was an amazing movie...Perfect for a Sunday Afternoon with your sweetie....
beautiful movie !
"awesome Story line , Robert Dinero surprising me in his role which he played fenominal."
Comedy and Drama well well balanced.
Moral views were √∞??
"?, I would watch it again and again ."
will win awards I believe
Who says chivalry is dead?
Who says there are not still great movies being made.
"Probably the idiots that write most of the movie reviews on Redbox, or Rotten Tomatoes."
The Intern was a fabulous movie.
"I would have given it four stars, but there was a plot point that wasn't that believable and therefore took away from what was else excellent entertainment."
As long as Robert DiNero keeps making movies like this in his seventies he could go down as the greatest male actor of our time!
"The chemistry between he (Ben) and Anne Hathaway ""Jules"" was dynamic and most enjoyable."
You could say they were better science buddies than DiNero and Jennifer Lawrence (Silver Linings Playbook).
I would give Ben and Jules) an A+.
I'll admit I was a little hesitant to see this movie...Anne Hathaway...
"I felt like she was getting too full of herself after hrr Oscar, Batman etc."
I'll tell you what I am once again a huge fan.
"(Anyone remember ""Far and Away?"")."
She was perfect for this role.
"I also enjoyed all the younger ""brat-pack"" they cast as Ben's sidekicks in the movie."
there were some really funny and charming scenes between all of them.
"I would put this right up there with ""Devil Wears Prada."""
I wanted the movie to keep hoing.
The characters were so enticing that you kept wanting more scenes.
(maybe a part II?...I hope so) DiNero proved in Meet the Parents movie how great of a comedic actor he is.
"I thought his character was funny and energetic and heart-warming, and classy, and everything else that is lacking in movies today."
"OK so I'm not going out on a limb when praising DiNero...I get it, but it is worth my time and energy to say how great he is in this movie."
I have been noticing and paying closers attention to musical scores in movies lately.
"I have seen some potentially good movies fall flat because of lack of music, or Too much noise."
In this movie it set a real good feel and tone.
The orchestrated music was symbiotic with the visual scenes.
"Like a perfectly mixed drink, just the right amount of sweet."
The songs that were used hit the right notes also.
"All in all a pleasant surprise and really hit the spot (won't say ""spot on"" because I'm not British, nor do I want to be)."
"Nancy Meyers wrote and Directed the movie and I have to give her ""Props"" it had same feeling as Sleepless in Seattle and other Nora Efron movies."
I won't forget my Handkerchief when I go to Church tomorrow.
"De Niro has found his second wind as a comedic presence, still hard to see ""Tommy"" from Goodfellas without thinking he's going to kick somebody in the teeth."
"Cheesy, rather predictable, but really heart-warming."
"Anne Hathaway is actually likable in this one, not many times I've found that to be true."
highly recommended.
affirms masculinity and true femininity.
"The worlds best optimist The Intern does not need to reinvent the wheel, and succeeds in doing what it intended, a feel good comedy about an unlikely friendship."
Where the Intern goes right is with its actors and characters.
Both have remarkable and fun chemistry which is both humorous and fun.
De Niro's character is absolutely irresistible as the teddy bear like Intern who turns Hathaways frown upside down.
"Another significant positive is that the film makes you feel very good throughout, really helping the viewer buy into this relationship."
"The film does not do anything remarkable, it is just a fun and cute simple and cliche movie that is just ""alright."""
It does have scenes that do not contribute to the plot.
Overall it is a fun and small film that knows exactly what it is even though it is faulty in the fact that it feels very predictable.
Rating: 7.2 (B-)
"+ Yes, maximal have-it-all chick flick."
But both those who like it and those who don't are correct.
So have a guilty look-see!
"Very pretty, shiny production."
DiNiro can do it all ... if a bit cliched !
"Nice movie, nothing special, just a nice movie."
Great feel good movie.
Inspires you to take a stand for doing what you love.
Very nice!
We all enjoyed this movie.
Great family fun together.
EXCRUCIATINGLY SEXIST!
Excellent movie which sends you on an emotional roller coaster.
Why didn't Robert DeNiro or Anne Hatheway receive Oscar nods for this movie?
I'm crying while typing this.
Everyone needs to see this movie.
"Despite a unique premise, ""The Intern"" can't overcome its trite and contrived storytelling."
A good old fashioned feel good movie.
Good work all the way around.
Not just a chick flick.
These two paired was genius.
Loved it but ending wasn't my preference.
i thought it was a pretty good movie
"Robert De Niro comes back from some ridiculousness to give us a great character, and proves great chemistry with Anne Hathaway."
"However, cliches and the strive for a feel-good-film hold back the potential The Intern was building."
"This movie was really pretty terrible, much worse than I would have guessed."
"Full of unrealistic and interesting plot lines, lackluster dialogue, a real waste of talent for both Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway."
I couldn't wait for it to be over.
Light and cute.
Enjoyed it.
"Okay film, was pretty good for the first hour, second hour the plot fell apart, had a terrible ending that ruined the two main characters."
Sweet movie.
"About hardships, trust, friendship and happiness."
shows that seniors can give great life lessons.
Surprisingly good.
De Niro and Hathaway carry the film as expected.
Great to watch with your ambitious partner or...your unambitious partner.
There's really not enough substance to keep the film interesting.
Throughout the film I was just curious what big plot twist was coming.
Turns out the twist was there was none.
This movie was horrible and couldn't get more cliche
"Nice, feel good, dramedy!"
I love Bobby D but this movie was beyond corny and not in a good way.
Acting w as stiff and dialogue nauseating.
"Una pelicula normalita, pero amable y agradable de ver."
"No habr√≠a pagado por verla, pero para verla en un avi√≥n como hice yo esta bien."
"Very warm, sweet story."
I loved this so much more than I thought I would.
Anne Hathaway and Deniro are both so good.
A surprising hit for me.
"I saw this more than once in theaters, and it's just one of those films you can watch over and over."
"Everyone did a fantastic job, especially De Niro and Hathaway."
Awesome all around; a classic Nancy Meyers movie.
"Sometimes charming, a bit too perfect ending, the movie has lazy script writing but still it's fun to watch."
"The performance of the leads - Robert De Niro and Hathaway are great, especially De Niro who carries the movie from the first shot with his pleasant personality."
"Muy dulce, muy correcta, sin ser tan cheesy."
"Bonita de ver, te deja con una buena sensaci√É¬≥n."
first half was really good.
second half not so much...
"Nancy Meyers is back with a flamboyant comedy, modern, inspired, light and refreshing but somehow built on solid values that everyone can relate to in some ways."
"A popular comedy with heart brain and some amazing human moments, this film is a little spark of hope and delight in times of highly dramatic Superheroes narratives usually lacking depth on the human level."
Anne Hathaway and Bob DeNiro will give you back some trust in our humanity and delivers terrific performances throughout the film.
Their alchemy is obvious and the film benefits greatly from it.
"I really believe this is a great film about our times, the changes, the struggles to adapt but also the importance of having friends, moral support and above all, people that respect you and love you unconditionally, because all that you will never get it from an app..."
It kept our attention with a continued interest in upcoming scenes.
Great chemistry between actors even with the gap in age.
"It's heart warming, funny, and smart all in one package."
"I wouldn't mind watching it a second time and recommend for men, women, and teens."
Probably the worst movie I've ever watched.
"So cliche & contrived.... Not only did I not laugh, I didn't even smirk."
The Intern is a usual comedy.
That's the only good and bad thing about it.
"It fails to differ from other movies of its genre, and is nothing unique, special, or creative."
"Still, The Intern is enjoyable, and successfully brings a smile."
Love DeNiro in any movie!
Filme super divertido!
"Fun movie, it has a real feel to it cause it portrays modern values very well, and talks about new york life style and who doesnt love that?"
But rather predictable...but in a good way.
You kinda want what you predict to actually happen at the end cause otherwise it would be too disappointing.
"Although ending is predictable, it also brings something fresh in movies."
Cute movie.
Robert DeNiro is lovely in this.
"This film is interesting since it does not follow the traditional film format, per se - but it still works."
Great Valentines Day flick with my husband.
The characters and acting make the film.
I'd watch it again and again.

"-Clem Bastow, schrijvend voor The Guardian suggereert dat slechte beoordelingen van de film voornamelijk van mannen komt, die de overgrote meerderheid van filmcritici vormt Goed geacteerd / vermakend"
An easygoing fun drama that should be an example of what drama is supposed to be and a classic that is fun to watch from time to time.
Robert de Niro and Anne Hathaway's chemistry is carrying the whole film on their shoulders.
boring and predictable
Great family movie.
"A few adult situations, but little to no swearing and no nudity."
Great acting from both DeNiro and Hathaway
Heartwarming and relevant story line
Full of clich√©s yet saved by a gentle unfolding of a developing friendship between the two main characters.
"A lovely, charming and wholesome film."
"I absolutely loved this movie, great cast, great script and direction from Nancy Meyer as well."
Robert Deniro and Anne Hathaway are great in this movie as well as two of the three cast members of Workaholics have roles in the movie as well and do a great job in their roles.
A definite feel good movie that will leave you smiling.
Disappointed.
A good comedy quickly turned dark.
"Di niro and Hathaway are amazing togther .Add a great supporting cast and a snappy, fun script and you have a couple of hours of escape fun and a good feeling exiting the theater."
Di Niro never ceases to amaze me with his wonderful ability to switch from Drama to comedy.
This is the sign of greatness!
Terrible film with a terribly boring storyline.
first half is great second half it falls apart .
should have been fifteen mins shorter
Beautiful movie that has covered so many aspects of our everyday life!
Nancy Meyers is an amazing producer!
"Brilliant movie, that puts you in such an ease and makes you want to watch more and more of it."
Lots of laughs and ending was a true blessing.
"We have rented it, but will buy it so that to support Nancy's beautiful job and for gifting us two hours of real joy!"
I do NOT like this movie.
"If the roles were switched and the woman was cheating on the man, he could have left her ass and found another one in a hot second."
"If the wife was cheating, shes a slut."
"Since the man is cheating, he is acting on an impulse."
Shits fucked up.
"This movie turned out to be, dare I say, a ""cute"" palette cleanser."
Bobby D is of ultimate class.
"In a span of 48 hours, I saw him in Dirty Grandpa and this, and you couldn't come up with two diametrically-opposed characters if you tried."
"For once, he's not playing a badass gangster (Godfather Part II or Goodfellas) or a raunchy asshole (the aforementioned Dirty Grandpa)."
"The movie also shines a light on milennial issues: The rise of technology, women running a company, stay-at-home dads."
"It's refreshing to see a movie where the conflict doesn't come from impending doom; instead, the conflict arises from strained relationships."
"The movie shows that everyone needs someone in their corner--someone to talk to, someone to be their rock in life."
very wholesome movie.
will be at the top of my list for a while.
A quirky weaving of two generations.
fantastic surprise of a film.
Robert de niro deserves more roles like this.
"This movie has such a warm heart, so it was almost impossible for me not to like it."
"Robert DiNero and Anne Hathaway give surprisingly deep performances, and have such amazing chemistry together, which was even more surprising."
The ensemble cast is also quite good as well.
This movie was a pleasant surprise and I definitely recommend it.
This movie was extremely motivational and told a story of an amazing tale of a woman who could balance a family and her very own business.
What a great movie!
Comical yet sentimental!
No cuss words and no sex scenes!
So refreshing!
Very watchable light comedy that gets a bit too cliche towards the end.
"3 for good effort though mostly from the supporting cast, but fell short in many ways."
Great tween & teen movie.
Most annoying cast was Anne Hathaway herself with a disingenuous performance fitting an out of control freak like leader.
"Depending on your mood, it's either terribly inoffensive or just plain terrible!"
thought I would like this one but it was kind of boring.
Good movie; definitely worth watching.
"The trailer (which I never saw) probably cast it as a comedy, but it definitely is NOT a comedy."
Pretty good light drama.
"Cute, but nothing special."
Inspirational.
Funny.
Heartwarming.
This move was as awesome as I expected it to be.
I loved how Robert De Niro played the senior intern.
"He fit that character really well, and made the whole plot much more hilarious than expected to be."
"Overall, the movie is a must watch!"
I enjoyed it very much not something I usually sit and watch I'm more in violence and horror but the story line was sweet to the heart
Awful.
An example of how me being open minded with Movies can sometimes blow up right in my hairy face.
"For those that don't know, De Niro used to be an Actor and starred in such films as Raging Bull, and Tax Driver,among many other Classics, now he's starring opposite Anne Hathaway (she is good usually but not in this) as an old man that gets...I can't even be arsed to explain, I think you get where I'm coming from."
"great acting, love the chemistry between RDN and AH"
So bad I can't even find the words to describe.
De Niro and Hathaway - together at last!
Did not expect to like this as much as I did.
"Goofy, broad comedy mixed with heavy personal drama, with some reasonably interesting things to say about gender roles and the role of the elderly in modern society."
But it's really the two heavyweight leads who make it so watchable.
"Sure, De Niro's golden age is behind him, but the depth and nuance he brings to kindly old gent Ben (played with subtlety, as this is obviously a less showy role than the Bickles and LaMottas) show that he still very much has the chops - he makes the role his own to the point that it's impossible to imagine another actor playing it."
"The Way is typically riveting, switching between the light and heavy with her usual skill."
"The movie has kind of a sitcom premise, but manages to rise above it to be a surprisingly affecting platon-com (patent pending)."
Eh.
Alright but I had hoped it would be more comedy ish
"The Film is nicely shot, composed and put together, Ann Hathaway puts on a great performance I like her more and more as an actress definitely grade A but I don't think this film has a the right message that it's ok to over work and not make time or some time for your families and not expect a negative outcome because of it, or maybe I'm just over thinking things."
The movie isn't shy about feminism but frankly I find it to be nonsense since Entrepreneurs who don't make time for their families male or female usually struggle in their relationships.
It's kind of the case with a lot of successful male Entrepreneurs since Entrepreneurship became a thing.
"The film though is a great insight into the lives of Entrepreneurs, they tend to put it more hours running their business than their employees, again regardless of a persons sex it's generally the same story for a lot if not all young business upstarts."
"I recently watched the movie"" The Intern,"" and I think the movie is great."
The chemistry between Robert and Anne is so fabulous.
"Despite I thought the movie was a comedy movie at first, it is a really warm and fragrant one that tears wear up in my eyes at the end of the movie."
Robert is so cute and he interpreted Ben really well.
"Although being aged, Ben still wanted to gain something in his late life."
He applied an intern for Anne's company not just because he wanted to do something but he wanted to be needed.
"He gave advices to Julie and people all around him, in other words, he was a wise man and very experienced in everything that people would encounter in their long life journey."
Sometimes you expect so hard and eagerly to show up a person who can give you advices to you when you have a hard time and I regarded Ben as the sage in this movie.
"Compare with Julie and Ben, life could be busy in former and could be hopeless and depressed in later, but watched how they hit a balance between their lives by learning from each other."
"I highly recommend ""The Intern,"" to all of my friends and you guys and I found umm... Nancy Meyers is a director that could really show gentle and subtle of the character and the playbook she wrote."
Love the movie love Robert De Niro so much.
Big build up to a disappointing ending but plenty of charm along the way.
Really feel good movie.
"I thought this was a pretty good movie,however I didn't like the way it ended."
enjoyable.but dont tell the wife i said that
A light-hearted performance from De Niro and Hathaway produces a great movie with a strong mix of emotions induced in the audience.
"The audience really grows to love both characters, and the way each interacts with other characters."
Strong performances.
Was it the glass of red?
I liked it!
Loved this movie.
"It was well done, had a sweet storyline and wonderful chemistry."
Sure to be a classic.
The Intern is a clean comedy movie that is actually fairly funny (rare thing these days) with a likeable cast.
And even when it's not being directly funny it's enjoyable to watch.
"Probably best of all, is that it doesn't follow a typical formula, like so many movies these days."
Only complaint is that the ending felt kind of abrupt and unsatisfying.
"With that said, I'm not sure how I would have done it differently either, so I have respect for the guts taken to end it there, when there was really nowhere else for it to go."
"okay but predictable; not half as good as ""its complicated"".."
The Intern is a cute comedy with lovable lead performances from Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway.
"De Niro plays a true gentleman in this movie, the kind of great guy we all strive to be."
He plays this perfectly and I loved him in the role.
"Hathaway could be annoying at times, but thats goes great with her character and growth."
Her strong friendship with De Niro is the highlight of the film and it completely works.
"The humor was extremely fun and it didn't feel forced, it flowed well with the characters."
My only real issue is that the movie isn't really original.
"While it has a fun concept, the movie doesn't try to be anything different or new."
It goes down exactly as you expect.
"But I really enjoyed The Intern, and I enjoyed seeing De Niro and Hathaway together even more."
It's a cute and sort of quirky movie that you just don't see anymore.
Un bon film divertissant √É¬† regarder en famille.
gr8 another lost review flixdicks!
"engaging, funny and touching... for someone my age, self reflecting."
Predictable performances by the two principal actors.
A pleasant diversion.
"A very moving film with a nice pace and rhythm to it, connecting on a lot of different levels from a retired boomer needing to find meaning in his life to a hard-charging businesswoman who also needs more meaning of a different kind in her life."
"Well acted, well written, well directed, this is not a sappy flic in the least but definitely a sensitive piece that won't piece that"
loved it!!
Ann is awesome and Robert character was realistic performed!!
something that older people are facing today's technology
One does not watch Nancy Meyers movies because they're experimental or hard-hitting.
"One watches Nancy Meyers movies because they are well put together, center on strong female characters, and have beautiful kitchens."
This movie does not disappoint on any of those fronts and it also pulls off the rare trick of focusing on a male/female friendship that has nothing to do with sex.
"Also, Hathaway and Deniro are very, very good actors."
"Pretty good, but plot was a bit too simple."
A good airplane watch
one of the best movies ever.. Hathaway and De Niro are phenomenal..
"This movie is basically Devil Wears Prada-lite, except the jokes aren't as good."
Every joke is about age.
Smartphones vs flip phones.
Writing vs typing.
Phone books vs contacts list.
You can guess how it ends.
"7.5/10 Very sweet (too much I think), feel-good movie."
Quite entertaining.
"Cute and amusing, with a good performance by Hathaway but very mediocre performance by De Niro in a fairly predictable and elementary film that ran a little too long."
Not something to go out of your way to see but enjoyable enough to watch.
"Enjoyable comedy, pace very easy to follow and very loveable characters."
Lightweight and fun.
awesome movie!!!!
!a MUST SEE!!
I don't know but I love it
Worst Ending Ever!
No closure and it's a pretty good film until it abruptly fades away.
It's almost as if they ran out of money or didn't know how to conclude the film.
It was pretty disappointing.
"Predictable, but, satisfying entertainment."
YES!!!
The Intern concepts are witty and adventurous!!
Deserving of a much more higher rating than these weird professional critics are giving it.
The Intern had me fully immersed in the movie with light hearted humour and relationships of emotional value!
"A very heart-warming, pleasant movie."
"Predictable and cliche, yes, but fun nonetheless."
De Niro and Hathaway alone give you two reasons to see it.
"Emotional, funny, heartwarming just to name a few."
This movie was my favourite romantic comedy of the year.
"Without knowing too much about the plot, I assumed this was taking De Niro down a familiar trodden path of another ""Fokker"" type role."
How wrong I was!
"This is a very endearing, gentle and easily watchable escapade that sees an ageing De Niro being given an internship with an e-commerce fashion company and becoming surprisingly useful at bestowing his considerable knowledge to his new colleagues."
I can't remember ever seeing De Niro play such a likable role without seemingly any flaws to his character.
Hathaway charms her way through the film and there's a nice cameo from Russo as a love interest.
A film that doesn't try too hard to be funny and comes across better for it.
Pretty good movie.
Really liked the acting and Hathaway and DeNiro played well off one another.
I think they left a lot of the story unresolved though - why was the relationship with her mother the way it was and what's the deal with the hubby...
"A lovely film about the value of relationships, including inter-generational ones."
Really uplifting.
Kinda loved the movie.
Its a light hearted comedy and refreshing.
Beautiful chemistry b/w De Niro and Hathaway.
Robert de Niro plays a very sweet grandpa-ish character.
Anne Hathaway is very convincing and most ambitous working moms will be able to relate to her character.
A cute movie to watch when you need to feel good about the dog-gone world.
"Starts out strong, but soon plummets into corny, pull at the heartstrings crap."
Heart warming and refreshing.
A definite own and recommend.
What a nice movie that gets you in the feels.
Well acted.
A story of how an old schooled retired widower helps a young overwhelmed business owner who needs emotional as well as business help.
Really good movie!
The trailer was misleading which annoyed me but the movie was a great movie!
Slow paced so I would suggest this for a chill lay in the bed and eat ice cream type of movie!
Awesome feel good movie.
My husband loved it too.
Funny and heartfelt.
"Pointless, plot locking, non scripted movie of dribble"
This movie was thoroughly pure entertainment and I loved everything about it.
It kept you on your feet and gave you a nice relaxed feeling to watch.
This movie was downright terrible.
The plot was obvious and at times condescending to the viewer.
"Overall very disappointing, these are 90 minutes that'll I'll never get back"
"Sometimes a mindless, fun, easy watch is exactly what the Doctor orders."
"When the afore is prescribed, ""The Intern"" will suffice."
A weird chemistry between our two leads provides a more than enjoyable experience.
No script no plot no humor no point no nothing.
"Is it a comedy, a drama?"
It doesn't really have an answer and the balance is not good.
"When there's a marriage twist at the end, I was done, especially with how they resolve it."
Stupid.
easily the best movie of 2015.
Anne hathaway's best performance ever.
Robert de Niro has a fantastic character.
all the side characters really work in the movie
It was playful and enjoyable.
I thoroughly enjoyed every step of the movie unfolding.
Nancy Myers directs and writes her next film in the Intern.
Anne Hathaway who played the clueless intern in the Devil Wears Prada now plays a CEO of her own company.
"The intern this time, is the 70 year old Rober Dinero."
Unfortunately Myers feels this premise is a lot funnier than it actually is and relies on this too heavily.
"The film relies on the typical jokes you would expect, many of which being an elderly person and their battle with new technology."
"The intern has some charm at first, but gets repetitive and really does not use the situation to offer much character development."
"The supporting characters offer the majority of the comedy, and scenes such as breaking into a house to delete an email come off as forced."
"The Intern feels long, and is not one of Myer's best."
"It wasn't predictable like other films, they were so many scenes that i expected something might happen, but didn't which is good, it made the movie unique in a way."
"It was also very realistic, literally almost everything they say in the film would be something we will say at work in reality, for an instance: when De Niro (who's actually in his 70's) said something about technology, it might take a little time for him to get used to it, that's what an adult who's over 55 would say."
"Anyway, this movie is great."
Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway worked together so well on screen.
I loved the friendship they developed.
There was a lot of humor as well as heartfelt moments.
And the little girl reminded me of my daughter.
"I think some time could have been shaven off at parts, but overall it was a great film."
It really speaks to women who want to have it all and how other people can't seem to handle that so well.
loved it.
Great lessons.
is always good to see Robert D Niro.
Experience never gets old.
I like the way they present how startup company work.
Casting was done by paid professionals -- the script was written by interns.
#interns
Fun movie and great message
This was actually a really good movie.
"Kind of a chick flick, but DeNiro never cease to amaze me by his acting ability."
His character is much different than the one we're used to.
Anne Hathaway is very good too.
"The movie is a perfect blend of ""old school"" thinking before the internet and new school creativity."
Would definitely see again in a few years.
This is a must see movie!!!
It brings you back to center and shows you what really matters in life.
Worth watching on DVD not worth the price of a movie ticket.
A mature and modern movie that is lifted into the charmosphere by two excellent performances from an in-form Robert De Niro and a luminous Anne Hathaway.
Cute and rainy-day suitable.
But not a lot of laughs or emotionally compelling.
This is a sad attempt at a second Devil Wears Prada.
Only watching it to the end because I paid to rent it.
Who knows if I'll even make it.
Great movie....... few life lessons in there for the younger generation
Anne vuelvo a ser tu fan.
Uninteresting characters doing absolutely noting interesting and a common and unambitious script.
Absolutely boring.
"What a wonderful movie, think Devil Wears Prada meets Bucket List!"
"Highly recommended, De Niro and Hathaway have a great on screen chemistry as tech world colleagues and unlikely best friends."
"Officially one of my fave De Niro films, of many many faves already."
It was simply a fun feel good comedy.
It had a decent story and some good acting and was just an enjoyable film.
"Nothing we haven't seen before or anything, but just good fun."
"This is the, for a lack of words, LAMEST movie I have seen."
It is unbearable to watch especially with a straight face
"It wasn't predictable as I suspected, it was sentimental and really cool actually."
I've missed watching a light-weight movie that is actually good.
I enjoyed it but it was very far from being a comedy.
Amusing but grounded movie.
I suffer from the disease of watching my favorites movies again and again and again.
I've added very few to my sickness until this movie.
"It's a movie that moves you to work harder on your passion, peace and your people."
Loved it was very good.
This movie has it all.
"A little romance, a little humor, a little sad, revelations about society as it was and how it is and possibly where it is going."
Overall very worth watching.
I'd have to say that this movie pretty much copies the Internship in plot minus a lot of the laughs.
"Some things just don't make sense, like why is Anne Hathaway's character a millionaire but the husband has to be stay at home dad?"
Deniro's performance pretty much saves the movie to be a total dud.
What a disappointing movie.
"Knowing the characters and the premise, it was never going to be a serious movie about serious things."
"However, it couldn't have been more predictable, with Hathaway in yet another movie moping around waiting for male characters to prop her up."
"Given the premise of the movie, it's shocking that this movie would struggle to even pass the Bechdel test."
What an insult to any women that have actually struggled and made it in roles and / or industries typically dominated by men.
"Such a cute, funny movie that has a simple story performed by incredible actors."
I haven't seen a really good movie in a long time and definitely recommend it to anyone!
A cute and feel good movie - no violence or drugs.
But still with some worthwhile themes and messages.
An okay movie that was calm and funny with a touch of emotion.
I was looking for a simply entertaining movie and found it.
"This film had humor, empathy and was so much closer to a modern day 'rom-com' than most movies are."
"It was different, modern, and all around great."
I love it and would easily watch it again.
Fue buena hasta el final.
"Proyeccion de mujer independiente, feminista, exitosa profesionalmente y despues perdona la infidelidad de su esposo.... Pendeja"
Melodrama pat√©tico y sentimental.
"La pel√≠cula trata de de generar empat√≠a por una mujer empresaria con una vida bastante privilegiada, quien se ampara en una figura paternal para atravesar una crisis laboral/personal."
"Cheesey moments aside, very enjoyable"
Lets just say it was awesome.
I saw it at nine o'clock with my 83 year old grandfather (who has cancer) and he stayed awake the whole time.
A fun and sweet movie which contrasts what once was with what now is.
It was fun to see de Nero in this unique roll for him.
"He did well, as did Hathaway."
Pleasantly surprised at how solid and delightful this was.
De Niro and Hathaway are great together and Nancy Meyers hits the most right notes she has in years.
this movie was great!
"I did not love the ending,I mean,I was expecting something better than that,it made me think for a moment that the director or writer wanted to diminish women's success in society...maybe I over analyzed it,I don't know...on the positive side,De Niro's character was very likable,he was always saying all the right things and making the right decisions.he also had a lot of chemistry with the rest of the cast,in other words: charming."
worth watching.
This was a really good movie.
Robert De Niro never ceases to amaze me.
It was a sad story but still so good.
"Emotiva y divertida, con un final muy malo"
Robert DeNiro turns on the charm to make this a very enjoyable film.
Anne Hathaway does a great job keeping up with DeNiro's character.
"This could have been a generic ordinary film, but all of the performances and direction make this worth seeing."
Really very good... Robert D is surprisingly great in comedies.
"excellent, a Must see!"
"The Intern: The latest film by director Nancy Meyers could have easy slipped into the realm of predictable, emotionally-manipulative schlock fest, were it not for the unlikely chemistry of its immensely likable stars, Anne Hathaway and Robert Deniro, who, as an over stressed owner of an Internet startup and the senior intern looking for meaning in his golden years, will have you rooting for them all the way to its oh-so-sweet ending."
B
De Niro rocked this movie.
Loved the plot progression.
Relatable
"The context of this movie is not only very timely, but it's also an overall, feel good movie!"
A movies does not need to be of academy award quality or super-hero based to be a great movie.
I disagree with the critics on this one.
simpaticno i sto bi se reklo sa dusom!
I had high hopes for this movie but it kinda let me down.
"The movie really doesn't establish much of a dramatic arc for Deniro's character-he's unhappy and then he becomes an intern and becomes almost imediatly happy, that's about the gist of it."
"Rather than the idea that both generations have a lot to teach each other, Meyers seems to think that it's a one way street, with the old sage guy handing down advice to a thirty something employee."
"This does not make for a very engaging picture, especially since Deniro's character is supposed to be the main character."
"The movie also really can't decide who's Hatthaway's character should be, we meet her as a quirky boss who rides a bike within her office and accidently gives her phone number to a disgruntles client."
but at the same time the movie also wants to make her inspire fear in employees similar to how Meryl Streep did in The Devil Wears Prada and the movie can not make these elements work in tandem.
"It's not all bad, the tech comany seems like a fun place and you do want to hang around these characters, but from a story telling perspective it's really weak, which makes the film seem overly long."
Nice story with Bobby De Nero and Annie Hathaway
A good role-reversal comedy in which De Niro plays a retired businessman who gets a jot as an intern at Anne Hathaway's character's Internet fashion company.
"Naturally, he is picked as her personal intern, and following her predictable rejection of his offers to actually do something, he gradually becomes her mentor and sounding board."
"While this will never win any awards, it's a good Sunday-afternoon-on-the-sofa movie."
Solid gold :) Loved this one!
Could have gone further.
Been funnier.
DeNiro and Hathaway have good chemistry in this movie and seem to feed off each other.
I little longer than needed to be.
This movie was awesome.
Very good movie.
My wife and I watched this at home.
This movie did not get dull and kept us entertained from start to finish.
Inspired me as well!
"An unapologetically sentimental Hathaway and an old-school senior De Niro delivers a movie in a genre Hollywood is generally good at and one that is a joy to watch, from beginning to end."
"With the people involved, The Intern is sweet and cute with not much else to offer out of its cast and generic plot."
While a few scenes were gratuitous the theme of people respecting and helping each other was well executed.
Casting was marginal except for Denero and Hathaway
Wonderfully pleasant comedy with thoughtful impact.
Found this a story pertinent in today's business world in the USA.
"Loves the actors, yes more could have been done with the plot/writting, will see agin on the small screen"
An enjoyable movie.
Light and charming.
Anne Hathaway is a successful internet entrepreneur facing the struggles of maintaining the life she built with her stay-at-home husband raising a little girl.
Robert DeNiro is the wise old gentleman participating in a new senior intern program at her company.
It all fits together in a pleasant comedic dramatization.
"Predictable, and a waste of time."
"horrible, nothing happens."
As sweet and classic as Deniro is this film truly is a calling card for how awful the new generations are.
"Also contains a segment of stupidity involving an email, horrible writing choice."
"wow, now that is one limbo dancer of a movie , yes the bar is pretty low"
Feel good fun movie.
Did not regret seeing it.
Love Hathaway and Deniro in just about anything... And their were meaningful moments along with the comedy...
"I gave it only three 1/2 stars because it was not Great, just Good."
"De Niro is actually terrible here, and the movie is just as bad."
"Expected move of a comedy, but a nice movie non the less."
Awesome movie!!!
Great acting by Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway!
Nancy Meyers' films are just getting cheesier & cheesier one after another.
Absolutely wonderfully done movie with awesome ideas behind it and great humor as well as deep though provoking moments throughout.
"This is one of those movies that make you feel good, remind you there is hope."
2 ud af 5 kontorclips.
Sv√¶rt kedsommelig og meningsl√∏s feel good-film om r√∏vfork√¶let forretningskvinde og hendes fadersubstitut af en pensionistpraktikant.
Det virker vildt forkert at s√¶tte De Niro til at spille flink og normal.
"Jeg ved ikke, hvem m√•lgruppen er."
Det er i hvert fald ikke mig.
"Complete feel-good fluff, but enjoyable thanks to DeNiro and Anne Hathaway."
"The whole thing was really ridiculous - but again, enjoyable enough."
Some good moments.
"The ""old guy with a computer"" jokes that you'd expect, but not too much - they just let the character be the character after a while - so, was worth watching."
Huge fan of this lighthearted movie!
Trendy and fun!
I so loved this movie!
"Simply enjoyable, a nice family-friendly-warm film about the important stuff."
"Both main characters play well, still maybe the plot could have been thicker to let them shine as well as they deserve."
"A sweet, nice and gentle ride with a laugh every once in a while that really does not take you anywhere."
Its still a very sweet movie though.
esta pelicula me encanto...para ser drama tenia muy buena comedia esta combinaci√É¬≥n de actores me encanto
She should of left that motherfucker
Tad long but solid dramedy
"First 45 minutes were cute and funny, then it devolved into more serious topics, stopped being funny, and became very boring."
O filme vai piorando ao decorrer dele...
An academy award nomination for Mr. De Niro.
He is THAT good here.
good acting nice feel good movie but oh my gosh the feminist bullshit in this one!
I know you wanna brainwash us hollywood but please can we ask you to reduce the dosage.
we cant digest all of that in 2 hrs.
"Surprisingly good, although the entire film is entirely predictable."
"wonderful movie, no words for de niro, annie beautiful."
a feel good movie.
Very likeable drama/comedy.
Hathaway owns it.
This one was definitely a fail.
"Good storyline, but the movie just doesn't do it justice."
2.0/5
"awesome movies, unique idea, highly recommended to watch"
"I really didn't care to go see this movie, but it was hilarious!"
Ann and Robert are phenomenal actors and I loved them together!
"Such a well-written, amusing story."
Highly recommend
Very educative...
I want to have the same energy he got at his age.
Not the comedy I expected but it was still a decent movie
It was fairly pleasant.
I was expecting an obnoxious Hathaway but she wasn't overpowering deNiro and her character managed to come off as real and vulnerable.
"Overall it was a good, relaxing movie...but far from great."
Was pretty decent but fell apart into sappy nonsense in the third act.
Part comedy and part drama.
Several parts were laugh out loud funny.
A very enjoyable movie.
Loved the two main characters and enjoyed seeing Renee Russo as well.
"The Intern has never offered something new and struck to be very sentimental, but it does pay off with good chemistry and a charming cast."
"""Um Senhor Estagi√°rio"" conta a hist√≥ria de Ben (Robert De Niro), profissional veterano, que consegue o trabalho de estagi√°rio numa empresa que vende roupas pela internet, criada pela empres√°ria Jules (Anne Hathaway)."
"O filme mostra o ambiente do mundo corporativo e o conv√≠vio de pessoas de gera√ß√µes diferentes, mostrando como a uni√£o de diversas compet√™ncias (experi√™ncia, resili√™ncia, ousadia e criatividade) √© fundamental para o sucesso de um neg√≥cio."
"O filme da diretora Nancy Meyers tamb√©m fala sobre rela√ß√µes humanas e como podemos melhorar, ou nos adequar, a v√°rios tipos de situa√ß√µes, sem perder a nossa identidade."
One of those feel good movies!
Generally can't stand Anne Hathaway and De Niro hasn't done much to impress lately but I really enjoyed this.
It's a pretty par for the course story that ends much how you'd expect it to but the journey was fun.
A fun story that is pleasant.
"Though the film itself as a whole doesn't quite prove to be as interesting as its premise, De Niro and Hathaway's charming combination made it work."
A good flick to watch with your date.
A very cute movie with some good advice about relationships and the art of how to be a man.
Very funny and touching.
Dinero is very versatile and we'll seasoned actor.
Never disappointed by his movies.
Great date movie.
Really liked this film funny at times and a very heart warming movie and the performances from the main actors and actress and amazing x
"A fresh movie, De Niro and Hathaway makes a funny chemistry."
Ofcourse De Niro shows why he is legend actor.
Really great movie.
the cast really made this a outstanding movie
"A very interesting, joyable, positive movie."
this was ADORABLE.
"great family, comedy, feel-good film."
i really love Robert De Niro -- and Adam DeVine.
"la forma en q Jules tomo la infidelidad d su esposo,Ben tan ordenado e impecable."
"""You're never wrong for doing the right thing.."" Loved the movie, great to see De Niro's charm back on screen."
was alright acting wise etc etc but I just didn't really see the point it never really goes anywhere
"A super-powered man who retired before and knows what the value of balanced life is, come back to save a passionate but kind of clumsy business woman."
"Some of cliches but still, it is worth to watch great acting of actors."
"A good movie with many heartwarming, feel good scenes."
The movie refuses to overplay the underdog part which works well as it allows the creation of positive emotional scenes right from the start.
The actors are well chosen and all have their good moments.
Screenwriting 101 at its finest.
"SPOILER ALERT So, I just got done watching The Intern featuring the ever charming Robert De Niro and exemplary Anne Hathaway."
(Not to mention the ever suave Rene Russo).
I have some kudos to give and a word of authorship to the script writers for the movie.
1
The movie was incredibly heart felt.
It touched me in all the right places.
It was sincere and earnest and never felt like it was over done or campy.
"The actors fell into their roles in cadence and it transported me from the beginning to the end, with ease."
2
Robert De Niro aced his performance.
The movie seemed to be written with an intimate knowledge of Mr. De Niro's previous performances and ability to transcend traditional roles.
I dare to say this movie may have missed its mark all together with an alternate selection for the lead.
3
Anne Hathaway and Rene Russo were charming.
I'm sure it wasn't easy for Ms. Russo to take a backseat to another leading lady.
But she did so with charm and finesse and her character took on the challenge of a supporting role and did so with grace.
4
The movie was heartfelt and plucked the right strings.
We felt the change of loyalty and even the butterflies of forgiveness.
But...and this is a very strong but... (SPOILER ALERT) The writer missed a huge huge moment to take this movie to a whole other emotional plane of existence.
Ms. Hathaway is at her wit's end trying to save a troubled relationship with her husband.
"So, she is trying to fill a vital role of CEO at her burgeoning company."
"Finally, she flies, with the company of Mr. De Niro, out to San Fransisco to meet one final and promising candidate for the position."
"After her interview with the potential CEO, she joins Mr. De Niro in the car that is bound for their return flight to NY."
He asks her how it went.
She goes on to profess how he was Smart and Kind and totally took her by surprise.
"The moment was so endearing, I felt the butterflies rise from my stomach and the tears begin to peak at the corners of my eye."
"Hope against hope I was waiting for her to extend her hand to Mr. De Niro and say, ""Congratulations CEO!"""
"That would have wrung my heart and made me fall head over heels in love with this movie, in a way unknown to me since Free Willy."
Did it happen that way?
Nope.
The movie dragged to make a quick recovery of Ms. Hathaway's failing relationship and ended on a furiously paced band aid for her broken heart.
Come on Hollywood Screen Writers!
"You get paid the big bucks, your duty is to elevate your audience."
This was a fantastic movie but you missed the big finale!
"All critique aside, thanks for a touching tale with a few laughs and surprises along the way."
"And a challenge to Big Hollywood, think outside the box, for once!"
- @josephamichael
a good little feel good movie to enjoy with a significant other.
"De Niro and Hathaway do well in their roles and in the end, the movie is entertaining, funny and a nice mix of drama to keep it all moving at a good pace."
DeNiro rarely makes a bad film.
It was enjoyable to see the interactions between a baby boomer and the Gen Y. Nancy Meyers best film since What Women Want.
It would have been interesting if the original cast of Tina Fey and Michael Caine went ahead as I think Tina would have been better in the role than Anne Hathaway.
"Anne was too ""sweet"" as a higher powered business executive."
A very heartfelt and feel good story.
Robert De Niro is great in it although the ending slightly disappointing.
A great story for a chick flick
"So is a heartwarming and lighthearted comedy that advocates respect for the seniors, family values and the courage to live your dreams."
"At first, I gave it a 3.5 stars rating, but then I got to thinking that the movie actually does a pretty shitty job of introducing a bunch of subplots and never getting them anywhere."
Cool to see Anders in a more dramatic role though.
"""You're never wrong for doing the right thing... but I'm sure Mark Twain said that once before."""
De Niro and Hathaway are not bad.
Did not like the ending.
A cute little film that has really funny moments and then dragged out moments.
"Not amazing, but not bad."
A good movie.
Anne and Robert did a great job.
Feminism - is it really a crime to be successful or passionate about ones career?
"Why do women lose their partner because their spouse does not feel ""needed""?"
"""Gender equality"" is definitely something that has to be more re-enforced."
Cheating- forgiving is not that easy.
"For one to simply apologize, and claim that he will not cheat again, hardly proves that the person is worth forgiving."
That I am not convinced... but that's a different topic.
For the record: saw it on a plane.
With a great cast and unique plot line Intern is a movie that you won't be disappointed by but also won't be one you'll yearn to watch again.
"Funny, witty and overall fun to sit down and watch with a loved one."
Idea had promising potential.
Was a let down.
Misogynistic themes posing as a feminist flick.
A new concept dragged down by old shitty cliches.
"Emotional, insecure struggling woman CEO needs perfect old white man to save the day."
Also men in general are typical silly cheating idiots.
For the lols.
And dumb CEO woman is too insecure to cut a cheating loser hubby.
"Movie lacked depth, lacked enough direction, lacked diversity, lacked a proper climax, lacked a decent conclusion, lacked general morals and lacked a good enough message."
Overall disappointment.
Hope someone else takes on the concept and does it better.
Good movie...made better with DeNiro.
"Without DeNiro, would've been a pretty dull movie."
Just an overall good movie
"Wow, what a great movie from beginning to end!"
Denise and I loved this movie.
I hope more - like this - make it to the big screen.
"It's a ""good for your soul"" kind of movie!"
very funny and touching!
"Definitely uber cute, the movie is very well cast."
"It delivers what it aims to (rom com, mushy scenes, good humour, predictable but involving story line) and does it subtly still."
I would rate this as one of the better rom coms of the year.
"Again, the acting is spot on."
It was a good enough movie.
I thought Hathaway and DeNiro were terrific.
"I just thought it ended in an odd, rather disappointing way (won't reveal too much about that)."
"Also, DeNiro acted as though he were part of an earlier time period (more WWII than Baby boomer)."
This is way overrated.
1.5 stars off for a lame stock score.
Not a Dinero fan and he surely sucked here.
"The idea ok, but story so weak."
"Nice story, great actors"
"Much better than I was expecting, funny stuff and definitely reccommended."
talent never age..it just improves...
Salute De Niro :)
"Not what I expected, at all."
Thought this was going to be a lot more about the business but instead it was a chick flick pretty much centered around Anne Hathaway's character.
"Having said that, it was quite enjoyable mainly thanks to the fantastic Robert de Niro who is just the greatest in everything he does... and she's all right too."
"So, I'd say not a must see but a nice one for a relaxing afternoon."
"Cheesy, mellienial type movie."
Lots of pandering.
One of the best films I've seen all year
Genuine and heartfelt.
Lots of great laughs from a fantastic cast.
Will definitely watch this again.
"Great movie, great lessons taught, amazing performances from Anne Hattaway and Robert Deniro."
Really enjoyed this one with my wife
"This movie could have done something completely different with the premise, and while that may have had more potential for comedy, I don't think that movie would have been as good."
"It's funny when it needs to be, and serious when the story requires as well, and it does both quite well, with good balance, and great acting from pretty much everyone involved."
"In the end it was more serious than the trailers let on, but I think that made for a better movie, and one that feels a bit unique as well."
Personal Grade: A Technical Score: 70%
"surprisingly entertaining, but AH's character could have been a bit more stronger and been less of a damsel in distress sort."
"""Friendship isn't about whom you have known the longest ...It's about who came, and never left your side."""
more heartwarming than funny but I enjoyed it.
"The Intern won't redefine cinema, not that it's meant to, but it's a sweet and clever crowd-pleaser that works equally well as a comedy and also dramatically, mainly due to the pairing of Hathaway and De Niro."
"With some genuinely insightful dialogue, a number of truly funny bits of physical business, and small scenes allowing us to get know and like a half-dozen supporting players, The Intern grows us on from scene to scene, from moment to moment."
"A poignant, character-based comedy about professional passion, the struggle to retain a healthy work-life balance, and how the unlikeliest of friendships can sometimes become the most meaningful."
De Niro and Hathaway are a surprisingly perfect pairing.
"Nancy Meyers delivers another funny, warm, smart and sophisticated comedy for adults that features Robert De Niro in perhaps his most likeable performance ever."
De Niro is his usual charming best and Hathaway takes what could have been a one-dimensional character and breathes life into her.
"The success of this film may ride entirely on the alchemy of these particular actors, but whatever is carrying it, The Intern gets there."
"With The Intern, Meyers has made another bright, contemporary American comedy with a lot on its mind - and works hard to make it look effortless."
"These days, it's tough to find a comedy that even aspires to sophistication."
"The Intern entertainingly fills that slot VERDICT: ""High-Quality Stuff"" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD."
"It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent."
(Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)
Absolutamente rid√É¬≠cula.
Excellent movie.
Nothing incredible but definitely charming and something to rewatch over and over
"The Intern doesn't do enough with its timely premise, but benefits from the unorthodox chemistry of its talented leads."
Movie Review Maven Grade: B In a Nutshell: Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway are some of my faves .
"Other faces you'll enjoy seeing are the beautiful Rene Russo, Adam DeVine, and Andrew Rannells."
"While the premise of this comedy is very sweet with great comic potential, the writing doesn't reach very far."
"It's pleasant, but bland; sweet, but forgettable."
"Director Nancy Meyers charms, yet plays it safe."
"Uplifting Theme: ¬∑ Everyone wants to feel wanted, needed, and relevant."
"¬∑ ""You're never wrong to do the right thing."""
"- Mark Twain ¬∑ Men, always carry a handkerchief."
You'll look classy and be a hero to someone someday.
Things I liked: ¬∑ I loved Ben Whitaker's (Robert De Niro) video application and the fact that he admitted that he had to call his 6 year old grandson to find out what a USB port was.
Ha ha ¬∑ I liked the way Jules' (Anne Hathaway) office worked.
"For example, the receptionist was really personable and friendly."
I like the idea of ringing a bell and offering applause whenever someone in the office does something well.
¬∑ Anne Hathway has such a beautiful smile.
¬∑ Rene Russo is aging so beautifully.
I take that back....she's not aging at all.
¬∑ I loved how Ben saw a problem and fixed it without fanfare (when he cleans up the giant mess on the company junk desk).
"Years ago I worked for a Congressman in Washington DC, hoping to make big contributions in American politics."
"One day, I cleaned the office kitchenette, because, frankly, it was disgusting and no one else was doing it."
"While I had wanted to save the world, the thing that everyone praised me the most for was being the one who actually took the time to clean the messy kitchen area."
"Ha ha If you want to stand out, do something that others aren't willing to do."
"¬∑ Overall, it's a clean date movie, which is refreshing in the wake of trashy movies like Trainwreck - If you enjoyed The Devil Wears Prada , Anne Hathaway's character in this movie will feel familiar, as if Andy grew up and started her own fashion business."
Things I didn't like: ¬∑ It's pretty predictable.
No big plot twists or surprises.
"¬∑ Robert De Niro's character is a little one-dimensional, with a goofy grin on his face most of the time."
"- A few amusing scenarios, but nothing laugh-out-loud funny."
¬∑ The movie preaches about having it all.
Can you really have it all?
Years ago I attended the Governor'sConference for Women in California (fantastic event) and that very question was asked of several high-powered women on a panel.
"They all chimed in about how you CAN, until finally, Meg Whitman (CEO of Ebay) honestly said it wasn't true."
She explained that you can't have it all....at the same time.
"For example, one day you can be the best business woman in the world, but then the house work is going to slide or else you're too exhausted at the end of the day to carry on a meaningful conversation with your spouse."
"Another day you can be Super Mom, but then you won't have time to exercise or pay your bills."
"Ultimately, there are only so many hours in a day and something usually has to give."
I appreciated the honesty of that answer and it has always helped me to set more realistic expectations about my day.
"Funny lines: ¬∑ ""What did you major in?"
"Do you remember?"""
"- ATF Interviewer #1 (Wallis Currie-Wood) ¬∑ ""Grey is the new green."""
"- Jason (funny man Adam DeVine from Pitch Perfect ) Things to look for: ¬∑ In the beginning of the movie when Jules rides her bicycle through the office, they had to have her ride extra slowly so the two girls could get all of their lines out during the scene."
¬∑ Ben's closet is pretty awesome.
"¬∑ Here is a question for you: If you knew someone was having an affair, would you tell the spouse?"
Is it your place to?
Would it help them or hurt them?
Tips for Parents: ¬∑ Jason hands Ben a newspaper to cover up his private parts when he's getting a massage.
"¬∑ Two F-bombs, but they're both mouthed and so you can't hear it."
Someone flips the bird.
"¬∑ Jules and Ben watch the movie An American in Paris , which your kids probably haven't seen."
It's a classic you should introduce to them!
"(On second thought, was it a clip from Singin' in the Rain ?)"
¬∑ Pre-marital relations.
"I loved this movie, such a good feel movie."
12/2015 In Hawaii with Kel and Tutu.
"Bit cheesy, but a pleasant experience at the end of a good day."
This movie was really cute and funny.
It touches the reality of how hard it can be for seniors to adapt to modern technology.
My only major complaint is the anxiety of worrying that I had throughout the whole movie.
"Funny, touching just has it all."
Pleasant but slow moving movie with likable characters.
Wait for this one on Netflix.
Theme is based on how much we can learn from the experience of our elders.
There are life lessons that we can't get from the fast paced tech world.
"Day: Wednesday Date: 20 Jan 2016 Time: 9.30 pm With: Maa, Azeem On: HDTV"
We really enjoyed this movie.
"Like sleepless in Seattle and when Harry met Sally, this movie has a familiar, feel good sense about it."
DeNiro play his part to a T and Hathaway is perfectly cast in this role.
"With a great supporting cast and a really good script, I would very much recommend this movie."
"Relaxing and fluent movie for sunday evenings,"
"A phenomenal film that surprised me, made me laugh, and kept me hooked to the very end."
Superb acting and even better writing.
Truly a must-see.
De Niro and Hathaway co-helm this Nancy Meyers offering about a overwhelmed internet start up creator who gets magical advice from a Spirit Father genie.
"Well, not that exactly, but so nearly that that the differences are hardly noticeable."
Hathaway is the beleagered company owner.
DeNiro the Spirit Father.
Meyers is the glass ceiling new feminist film makers have to break past to be taken seriously.
"She's like Sinatra doing a Beatles song - it could be interesting, but her time, her style, is dated."
heart warming and makes you think again about the wisdom that grows with age and how you have a lot to learn from the elders
"Watchable and DeNiro is excellent but after viewing you can't help but feel, what was the fucking point?"
Great movie.. my husband said he would have gone to the movies to see this one.
I like movies like this good fur the family!!!
Would watch this agin!
This was actually a very pleasant surprise.
"It's definitely not STAR WARS, but this is definitely a must see....."
"This was a smart and funny and very, very, very brilliant movie."
This was a fun twist from the usual approach to comedies dealing with generational differences.
The cast is top-notch and the story is more than just the light fluff expected from these comedies.
The Intern avoids two major cliches.
It does not turn De Niro's character into a joke in a 'what's-that-old-man-doing-here?'
"way you might expect, and downplays his thin technology skills."
"That is it does exactly the opposite of what the recent 'intern' comedy about Google did a few short months ago, and opts instead to tell an actual story about people."
"It also avoids another major cliche that goes to the heart of the plot, so I can't reveal it."
"So while this film is not an earth shattering moment in the history of cinema, it quietly goes about its business in a more intelligent way than most mainstream comedies (dramadies) and I appreciated that."
Though it takes acting talent as good as Hathaway and De Niro to pull something like that off.
"When you don't get your mileage out of stuffed bears giving the finger, little dogs jumping out of windows, or people accidentally lighting their hair on fire, you find yourself in a situation where you actually have to act - because all the absurd distractions common to today's comedies are absent."
Hathaway and De Niro pulled it off with great skill.
Writer and director Nancy Meyers continues to display her abilities in both roles with THE INTERN.
Meyers' work is polished in every regard.
"Perhaps the silliness of certain moments in the script reaches what feels like great stretches in the aesthetic framework of the movie, these moments also constitute what are arguably necessary beats for the whole show to be dramatically effective."
Meyers is unmistakably purposeful.
"She is, however, clearly not writing for everyone."
"As critic reviews will bring out, THE INTERN is not as nuanced as some would like it to be."
"For her intended audience, though, the movie hits all the right emotional notes while still leaving them with bits of wisdom to chew on."
"Specifically, THE INTERN does not simply make fun of differences resulting from age gaps (although it does capitalize on some generational disconnects for several amusing moments), but reminisces and then proposes that some ""old ways"" of doing things may still be valuable."
"Essentially, the young are reminded to learn from their elders."
"The ""moral"" of the movie can certainly be complicated beyond that, but the afore-mentioned theme gets at the gist of the values that can be excavated from the picture."
DeNiro and Hathaway have excellent chemistry and their on-screen relationship seems comforting and maybe a little familiar without feeling cliche or worn out.
Their performances breathe life into Meyers' script that may have come off as less interesting in the hands of other actors.
"THE INTERN does not particularly break new artistic ground, but it is none-the-less fun, wise, and emotionally satisfying."
"As far as predictable pseudo-father/daughter vaguely rom-com-y fare goes, this one wasn't half bad."
"Like the Anne's character said in this movie ""Chick site"", it's a really cheesy movie."
"The De Niro character lack of personality, I suppose that's because of the mood of this movie."
"Everybody is happy at the end (but it sounds so fake somewhere, even if we want to believe it)"
D√™m um papel consistente ao De Niro que ele ainda sabe representar.
Din√¢mica interessante com a ex-Disney bipolar Anne Hathaway.
"Em resumo, 90 minutos bem dispostos."
"Loved Deniro, hated the film."
"nice movie, adorable performance from lead roles."
A very cliche and heartwarming flick that relies heavily on two brilliant performers.
The film would lose much of the appeal if it was anyone else leading the film.
It is so unusual for me to see De Niro as a charming guy after all those other roles he's had over the years.
Sometimes films like this shows that the same script can be used over and over again yet still feels new and enjoyable.
Charming.
"Always love Anne Hathaway in this kind of movie, and I love the chemistry between her and De Niro here."
"If the film didn't have such a preachy undertone, it would have been a much better film, but we should expect strong female leads and an old wise man from a Nancy Meyers project, right?"
Right.
Lovely!
In a charming way.
nice wine an pizza movie
"Few movies will enthrall you like stroking in a feather, lets you feel a gentle breeze and to go back to bed with a quiet mind like a pristine lake."
This is one such movie.
"It throws many good things for everyone to learn, understand and live but you will see them in the movie only if you want to."
I could not say just a few things - there were many.
The story line was pretty straight.
Is Jules going to run her dreams by saying no to a ceo or stays back and let a ceo in.
"As an audience you feel saying it in the very beginning of the movie itself like ""Come on jules you can do it !"
"!""."
But that not how its going to work in real life.
To advise others is the easiest thing to do.
You might knew what's right for your friend but we miss to see the situation from their shoes.
You should wait for them to realize and analyze the crisis and let them swim it.
And that's what ben does and the character was scripted as on how a matured and righteous person will react to every situation.
"When davis had problem to find a place he didn't offer his home right away, he did let him find things by himself but when he had no other option other than leaving the place, he offered help to share his home."
Ben felt bad seeing matt having an affair and could not say it to her.
Marvelous acting by Robert De Niro.
You cannot hide all your emotions and he revealed that in a great acting.
"After seeing matts affair, when in office where jules and everyone finds out that ben is disturbed - Ben could not swallow and digest what he saw and could not spit the same out."
Revealing it to Jules and might have had egregious consequences in her life.
"But when jules finds it out, he was there to listen and talk with her."
Dialogues were crucial there.
He didn't advise even a bit anywhere about the situation.
He asked not to worry as she can be burried next to him.
Consoling with a magical touch.
Even when jules stopped by his home in the end of the movie - he delivers his thought on why she should run a company in a pleasing way stating you might have taken that decision by now but you stopped by here to see me to get an assertion that you are making the right decision.
That was so awesome.
He didn't advise on that topic throught out the movie.
Few would have advised the moment they over heard the conversation jules had in conference room.
The character of ben is a summation of maturity and all goodness that a human being should possess.
"Listening to people, helping when needed, clean up things even if its others mess without ego, never stop to learn new things, respect fellow human being, never forget to laugh, what empathy is, when to talk, how to handle a crisis in life, respecting your spouse and to be happy with what you have got."
Awesome work by director for coming up with such a script.
This is a movie to preserve.
"Nancy Meyers maakt het soort film waar ze goed in is, waarin de juiste chemie een tijdloze situatie maakt voor een film die lekker onschuldig is."
A wonderful performance by De Niro but the movie's schmaltz and slight storyline make for a predictable experience.
"It doesn't really get as much comedy as it should out of its strange premise, and it does occasionally begin to tire and/or start to get weird, but, thanks to the decent cast and their chemistry, as well as some actual sentiment towards the end, it manages to stay afloat."
Bring some √∞??¬¥√∞??¬º√∞??¬µ√∞??¬º.
They'll get all the jokes that fly over your head (read: many jokes).
I have always loved watching Robert De Niro in comedy.
It's as if The Intern was written with him in mind.
The film begins well but sinks heavily into melodrama with a predictable ending.
"A lot of charm, and very entertaining."
It's a lighthearted film.
"Pleasant enough film if somewhat predictable after the initial ""old-man-as-intern"" novelty has been sprung."
Hardly a stretch for the lead actors.
The writer/director has obviously too much of the LA New Age thing that she wants to translate this for the NY audience.
"Watchable and Deniro & Hathwy definitely connect -- but darn it does she have to CRY so much and be such a ""raging bitch"" at the same time?"
"Silly segways such as ""steal your mom's computer"" is just, well, silly and unnecessary, so is exploiting all the cliches (tho much true) about the millenials."
More charming than I anticipated.
A good team.
A different subject.
Well done.
Was a refreshing and compelling look into the ever changing gender norms in the 21st century America.
It was very slice of life-y.
"A large hole remained in Jules' relationship with her mother, which was brought up multiple times but never resolved."
"This also began with Ben's journey, and would have benefitted from a reflection of where his character is now as a result of this internship."
Altogether enjoyable.
"Great, cute movie."
It was so refreshing to have a main character you trusted not to make a stupid mistake and instead let a good story drive the plot.
"Maybe it's because I'm a 60 something, but myself and 3 guests thought this movie was funny, warm, sincere, emotional and very entertaining."
"There were scenes that made us roar with laughter, and scenes that brought tears to our eyes."
Both DeNiro and Hathaway gave believable performances .
I give it 5 stars for entertainment.
I loved it
THE INTERN starts off as retired but bored Robert De Niro joins a vibrant web start up headed by the workaholic Anne Hathaway.
The idea is cute and the jokes write themselves.
"But unlike many movies based on unusual premises, this movie quickly moves on from the quirkiness of the pair up to bring us a truly moving and interesting story."
The two stars are firing on all cylinders throughout the movie.
"Their relationship, acting chops and a good script manage the feat of conveying Hathaway's intricate - and not entirely predictable - character development in an unusually believable manner."
There is one particular scene - during their business trip - featuring just the two stars where I felt like I was seeing some of the best acting I have seen all year.
"And while De Niro and Hathaway are brilliant, a charming supporting cast also surrounds them."
I particularly like this movie due to the male/female role reversal in Hathaway's personal life that we also saw in this year's TRAINWRECK.
"While THE INTERN deals with a different slice of life as Schumer's summer comedy, we once again find the pattern of a woman living in what was traditionally a male role."
"This time that of a harried, passionate entrepreneur who struggles to keep up with the success of her start-up while simultaneously attempting to balance family and work."
THE INTERN will not get any awards or even nomination and will most likely not be remember in the annals of movie history.
But it is a great example of a movie that is everything it could be.
"So if the premise intrigues you, and the trailer seems like something you might enjoy, then I can guarantee you will enjoy it."
The Hollywood film industry is stuck in a bubble.
"I watched ""The Intern"" on my flight home --- wow."
"Aside from the usual outrageously racist casting (par for the course in Hollywood: almost every employee is white, not a single East Asian employee as far as the eye can see --- in a tech startup with 200+ employees?)"
"The storyline is filled with anachronisms pasted over startup cliches ... yes, it's open-plan, but the female CEO has a giant, walled-off office cut off from the rest of the floor (fairly uncommon for early stage startups)."
She has a secretary (!)
who follows her around and reminds her of her schedule.
"The investors want to bring in an outside CEO, despite the fact that the company is wildly successful."
The female CEO needs to have a condescending talk from her (white) male subordinate about how she needs to cede authority to an older (male) CEO to take over for her.
"She rides a bike around the office, but has a private chauffeur to take her to and from work in a giant SUV."
"Her husband is a stay-at-home husband, because, of course, if you have children, one parent must stay at home, and if the wife works that means the husband has to give up his career --- because two-parent working families are out of the question."
She's supposed to be a startup CEO but she can't figure out how to turn off the keyboard clicks on her iPhone.
"It's set in 2015, but all the tropes seem to be from some version of the 1940's, except with glass walls and laptops instead of typewriters."
"The film industry is increasingly isolated, cut off from the rest of the world --- I suppose it's always been that way, but there's something really lazy about the insularity of it, particularly in a rapidly changing world."
"The vapid recycling of outdated tropes, the lack of anything but the most superficial research into anything outside their preconceived notions of social and economic changes, the lack of engagement with contemporary issues, it's really sad."
"The casual racism of nearly-all-white casting (Asians typically make up about 1/3rd of startup staff, yet in Hollywood, we're nowhere to be seen) is just one of many bizarre disconnects between reality and Hollywood."
"It is such an important industry, it literally creates the dreams of our civilization, yet they're increasingly cut off from the day to day lives of people working in anything they are unfamiliar with."
No ei t√§m√§ aivan kelvoton ollu.
The Intern is a interesting little comedy\drama that centers on a retired man played by Deniro who interns for young CEO Hathaway.
It has a few funny moments and some great performance from its leads and its supporting cast but there isn't much of a story here.
It drags along and doesn't have a satisfying enough ending.
It's worth a rent at least once for the performances but just don't expect to be blown away or anything.
This was sort of a ute akward movie to see the funny but normal lif free of a old man.
It was good how they showed a senior working with future technology and being nice than others.
"The plot was missing something more, but it still ended ok."
A very surprising and sweet film!
De Niro and Hathaway were excellent!
"Just a wonderful, extremely feel-good movie."
Thoroughly enjoyed it.
Brilliant De Niro performance.
Too many critics in their 30's don't quite get it!
I liked the story and the actors.
Enjoyable modern office comedy-drama.
Both acting and story quite solid 8/10 Rev 284
A good comedy starring DeNiro and Hathaway.
The intern in this case is DeNiro that has got tired of his retirement.
He sees a post about an internship and have to struggle to get in to the bosses good grace.
A loveable movie about how being old isn't being worthless around a workplace.
With age comes experience.
"DeNiro is the kind ""uncle"" who helps everyone and Hathaway is the loveable but overworking boss that started her own company and of course have issues with giving her family the time they need."
I found it brilliant and somewhat very satisfying.
"Even though the premise is predictable, its cast plays a major role in its firm stand."
Darling.
Much better than I thought it would be.
Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway are phenomenal in this feel good movie.
Enjoyable from start to finish.
This movie makes the grade of above average completely because of the acting.
Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway are indisputably world class and they both turn in efforts reflective of that.
It's worth seeing if you just really like good acting.
"I don't really look at movies very analytically, so I'll just stick to what it did for me."
"It made me laugh (really embarrassingly hard at one point), uncomfortable (but not to the point of disturbed) and relate."
"I'm not much the cryer, but were I, I don't think this would have done it."
I think all of this makes it a decent flick.
"It did not sync up with my experience regarding either demographic (older retired and young hip), but it did make me want to appreciate both."
"Honestly, go see it just to see what you think."
You won't go home disappointed.
The Intern (2015) is a drama/comedy film starring Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway.
This film has a more realistic today's generation family business story which actually hits home in my life.
The movie was well put together and the cast could have not been any more perfectly selected for such a film.
The Intern (2015) brings good classy comedy to the table while taking you through the day to day of a 70 year old intern in the tech world.
This film does have it's usual styling or theme as all other films within this genre/classification though it does have a nice spark to make it stand out from many.
The Intern (2015) is enjoyable for all ages and didn't come slam packed with innuendos and quick one liners like most of the films from the last decade.
I tip my hat to those who worked hard to make a very well produced classy comedy.
Loved It..DeNiro is Great think he will get a nod for this one
I liked this movie.
I will give it the Rotten Tomato rated fan average.
The fans are always right.
The critics can suck it...SS
Very poignant and charming
Watched this with my mom.
"Thankfully this was appropriate for her age, and it was a feel good movie."
Robert DeNiro was amazing in this movie.
He was witty and had great chemistry with Anne Hathaway.
I was sad that it ended.
I was hoping she made him the CEO
"De Niro's experience and Hathaway's adorable charm and a nice mix of chemistry between the two, makes this silly storied movie a pleasure to watch...."
It is the chemistry between the two main stars that keeps this film together.
Worth watching for that alone and well the usual elements and events in films of this nature come around.
"Touching, funny and more enjoyable than you might think."
The Intern (2015) is a cute film.
Robert de Niro's over-expressive facial acting grows tiresome about halfway through the runtime but the film is more than capably anchored by Anne Hathaway at her charming best.
Old guy feel good time waster
"Funny, but too predictable"
Typical rom-com.
Okay movie.
A light-hearted movie that's a lot of fun.
Ending was less than desirable.
"Une comedie romantique gonflee aux conventions hollywoodiennes, mais sauvee par le couple De Niro Hathaway et par l'approche sociologique americaine plutot fine de Nancy Meyers..."
Cheesy but good chemistry.
"Charming and heartwarming, The Intern is a bit overlong and Anne Hathaway somehow manages not to get under the skin."
"A ""nice"" film."
A movie filled with smiles and laughs.
"Not the Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Godfather of De Niro that we're used to loving, but a pleasant and charming version."
"Hathaway is her lovable and charming self,"
"Funny, enjoyably charming and heartfelt, The Intern may unnecessarily stretch its running time but strongly benefits from the terrific chemistry and performances from Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway."
Great story with a very friendly and welcoming touch.
But should be a little more focus on characters and the ending could be more clear.
Entertaining film.
DiNiro is good as usual.
Even tempered film that matches his Ben character.
Boring and no point really to it.
I'm a big Nancy Myers fan but what was she thinking with this movie .
"Cute and heartwarming on a number of levels, this film was nearly perfect (a few of the masseuse scenes were unnecessary and some of the plot twists were cliche)."
I'm not sure what I like most about this movie.
It could be its perfect casting choices.
It could be its natural and clever dialogue.
"It could be highlighting the importance of classical ""manhood""."
"At any rate, it shows that all generations have something to offer and once we get past the preconceived notions about a person, we can see what value they truly hold."
"Boring and pandering, The Intern - despite telling a story as languid and cliche as its protagonist - is all over the place."
It feels predominantly like an old-folks' flick (i.e.
"Exotic Marigold Hotel, Philomena, etc."
"), oh but suddenly you've got some gentle douche humor from all of the workaholics, oh and you've got Anne Hathaway, an 'e-commerce' (whatever THAT is) mogul."
Why?
"Because women be shoppin' I had one obsessive, recurring thought running through my mind, and I think it made me bristle more at every pleasantly retarded little moment - this is Travis Bickle."
This is Travis.
Fuggin'.
Bickle.
A touching story with a great performance by Anne & Robert.
Didn't know what to expect from this movie but I knew with Robert Di Niro and Anne Hathaway in it the movie had to be funny at least.
It was and it was every other emotion too.
Being older and having lost his wife he was able to be a mentor to all the younger male inters as well as others in the office.
There was a line of the movie that stuck with me and rings true.
I'm not good at quoting but it was something like this.
When did men stop being men and remain little boys?
We stopped calling women girls but why did we stop using the word gentlemen?
Then she looks at the 3 guys that are also interns as well as Ben (Di Niro) and they are dressed in casual rather sloppy clothes and he is wearing a suit and tie.
Looks very nice IMO and I have to agree with her.
That MEN are a dying breed and they're being replaced by boys.
"She wasn't making a feminist statement, it's that at all."
"Women WANT MEN, we don't want 40 year old boys who still dress like they're in college and play video games!"
So I loved that she and Ben had become friends not just work colleagues.
That was my favorite thing about this movie and probably why I enjoyed it so much.
He may be retired but he still has a life and a purpose.
People NEED him.
"I really liked they showed that senior adults still have very active social lives after they retire because SO MANY in my generation seem to think once you hit a certain age, everything I guess just stops?"
Had this exact discussion with a 41YO guy from high school just a few weeks ago and was floored by his ignorance because he's actually rather intelligent.
Book smart not common sense smart.
He wasn't the first to make such an asinine statement.
Having been my MIL caregiver this movie reminded me of her and my Mammaw because they both had more active social lives in their late 60s than I did in my late 30s!
The reason is they were single and I'm married so I don't go out with a different man to a dance or movie or dinner.
LOVED that Ben took his first date to a FUNERAL!
"I died laughing when he gave the lady chasing him the ""I'm sorry"" look!"
Robert De Niro has graced movie goers with his presence for fifty years.
"We have seen him play mobsters, lunatics, a comedian, protective father, and many more."
"In the The Intern, we are able to see him play someone new."
"Although known for his ""tough guy"" roles, De Niro finally plays a softy."
Ben (De Niro) is a retired widower looking to fill in an empty part of his life.
"He applies for a senior intern position at an e-commerce fashion company, About the Fit."
He is accepted.
"Ben gets paired with Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), the busy founder of About the Fit who barely has anytime to even eat."
"Jules is a very independent, self made women who believes an intern can only be a distraction."
She soon discovers Ben's great work ethic and caring ways.
Eventually Ben becomes more than just the intern as the two form a friendship.
"Going into this film I was not excepting much, but The Intern ended up being my favorite feel good comedy of the year."
"De Niro gives a performance that is so warm, you can compare it to your favorite blanket."
"Ben is a man filled with empathy and wisdom, the ideal grandpa and mentor."
"Ben carried such kindness with him, it will be hard re-watching De Niro in his mobster roles."
Anne Hathaway also gives a sincere and heartfelt performance.
"She divides her time with being a mother, wife, and running a company."
"Just like Ben, I really cared about Jules and wanted her to be happy."
There is amazing chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway.
"Completely platonic, almost like a father/daughter relationship."
During the film it felt like I had a inside look at their lives.
"We were able to follow Ben and Jules morning, afternoon, and night."
"Because of this, I became very attached to these characters."
There lives seemed so real.
"Much like Ben, I am a softy at heart."
"Once again, director Nancy Meyers has reminded me of that."
Great very enjoyable I laughed sang amazing movie there was even applause at the end √∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞??¬Ø√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???
****
"Good movie, But I don't understand why Hollywood always has to stick in a theme about adultery!"
"They glamorize it and make it seem like infidelity is not a big deal, so false!"
Robert Deniro and Anne Hathaway have great chemistry in this less than stellar story about a business woman who is trying to balance her home life with running her successful business.
Riveting.
And a great combo of Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway.
Great film with interesting and real characters.
And I always love it when I cannot predict the ending...
It feels more like a chick flick than I would've guessed and can be cheesy at times.
But who doesn't love a bit of cheesiness every once in a while?
"The movie kind of acknowledges that it's cheesy and has very funny, deliberate over the top moments."
"There are so many lifelike details that contribute nothing to the plot or overt characterization, but nevertheless add a sense of reality and beauty."
The chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway is touching and refreshing.
"One of the cutest, simplest, and most enjoyable movies I've ever seen!"
Great role for DeNiro
"Like all sensible human beings, I'm a huge Robert De Niro fan; it's no wonder The Intern piqued my interest."
"Alas, De Niro's character is far and away supersedes competing elements of this flick."
"Simply put, there's not enough substance or climax in The Intern to totally win the filmgoer over."
"Inexplicably, the plot shifts focus from DeNiro's Ben to Anne Hathaway's Jules midway through and never looks back."
"Transposition is a tricky ingredient in the recipe for cinematic success, and it only works a small percentage of the time."
Nancy Myers' new film is in the failing majority.
Best movie I've seen this year!!
"Funny, clever, with a great message"
"An endearingly charming chemistry exists between co-stars Robert DeNiro, playing the wise and affable retiree who's eager to feel pronounced in his senectitude, and Anne Hathaway, playing the young peremptory executive he is interning for."
"The smooth progression of their relationship is delightfully affecting, ultimately submitting a platonic father-daughter eminence that exceeds the more mundane facets of its frail plot."
[C-] -- 54%
"It was a heartfelt movie, and had some funny points about growing older and how someone retired can still add good value to the younger generations."
I wish my current office was as fun as the one in the movie!
Anne Hathaway and Robert Deniro along with everyone else did an amazing job.
Such a feel good movie.
Can't wait to see it again!!

"The Intern is a funny, charming, riveting, and sweet dramedy and features a great performance and chemistry by Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway."
"This is what i would call a perfect movie, it was not over done and it did not use any cliches i could see."
I would see it again and i think we need to own this movie.
It was a little long but it was funny and it kept us following all along.
Some very laughable parts
Heartfelt and hilarious!
More of a chick flick than I'd anticipated.
"Met de chemistry van Robert de Niro en Anne Hathaway kan The Intern bijna niet misgaan, toch heeft de film last van een te lange speelduur vol onnodige zijplotjes en overbodige karakters."
The Intern is op zijn best wanneer De niro en Hathaway samen te bewonderen zijn op het scherm.
Well told.
Great chemistry between Anne and Robert.
Please watch this good one.
Not the greatest but very good.
It met my daughters and My objective for enjoyment.
Good movie to make you fall asleep.
Fantastic movie!
Smart and funny and a good message.
"this is a example of a true relaxing experience, with a great cast and perfectly sculpted screen write it a great film if you want to just enjoy a good movie."
Really loved this!
Cute!
great movie lots of laughs.lots of tears.
wasn't real excited to see it.but really glad I did.
"a promising intern, let down by a run-of-the-mill corporation"
A really feel good movie Best I've seen in a long while
Script is too loose.
Big deals are made of things that are either forgotten (wasn't someone supposed to bring guacamole?)
or have lame payoffs (the blinking bit).
"Ultimately, none of the characters change or grow."
The only difference between the beginning and the end is that Anne Hathaway has a new friend in Bob.
Could be a great made-for-TV movie if one were to stumble upon it while sick in bed.
Amazing movie.
Very heartfelt and cute.
I think these two made an amazing acting team together.
"I love both of them anyways, but this took a turn I didn't expect."
I very much enjoyed this movie.
"It took old school, and new school, and mixed them together for a very enjoyable comedic adventure."
A heartwarming expression of inter generational relationships found in the two main protagonists.
"Dinero expresses an embodiment of Mr. Fredrickson from ""Up!"""
with less grump and more spunk.
And Hathaway does a wonderful job of being a successful millennial caught up in today's fragmented world.
Worth watching and heart warming; makes me happy for expressing the value of retirees in society and the value of all their life experiences.
"Watchable, if rather eyeroll-inducing at times, especially when characters talk about their Issues."
"Thank goodness for the chemistry between the leads, otherwise it might just be unbearable."
"Fun, thoughtful, and interesting."
Great acting by Hathaway & DeNiro made a cute movie an Awesome Story !
No chemistry between Deniro and Hathaway...characters appear to go through the motions.
An enjoyable film that is filled with comedy and a good plot.
One of the best!
"Funny, touching and feel good movie."
"Mediocre story, funny, great performances, just a pleasant little movie that i enjoyed with some of my favorite actors."
Nothing special but delivers a simple story in a beautiful way.
Boring from start to finish
My wife wanted to see this one so I opted in.
"De Niro and Hathaway have a complementary old/young chemistry that makes the story work, each rescuing the other."
The movie makes fun of the generational differences we all have in a practical and funny way.
Worth a trip to the big screen.
Sincere family movie
great movie.
bad ending.
the movie kind of just stopped.
"the first half was ok, but the second half was very cheap to me."
Clever!
Funny!
Humorous!
Smart!
"Great movie, lots of laughs."
Robert Deniro is adorable and portray's this Senior intern perfectly
Entertaining - not NM's best.
"Clich√É (C), mais un tr√É¬®s bon film malgr√É (C) tout!"
Belle prestation pour Robert DeNiro et Anna Hathaway.
On s'attache aux personnages.
On souhaite m√É¬™me avoir des stagiaires s√É (C)niors dans notre compagnie maintenant!
"Cleverly touches on: bridging generation gap, gender roles, optimism and old age."
Did Robert de Niro really need to walk around with a stiff neck?
super great awesome sweet
I thought this was a comedy...it's not but it was still a good movie.
"We knew the ending before the end, but this story explains the success & pains of successful women today."
"Also, where retirees stand in this generation qith their knowledge."
fun movie entertaining wife liked it fun to watch to outstanding actors with a huge age gap create such great chemistry worth the price of admission
"It was fairly lame, but the lead actors did a good job."
Robert DeNiro is really special.
"Great story telling, great writing, great acting."
"Hathaway and Deniro are extremely genuine, likeable and vulnerable."
"The film paces beautifully, kudos to the editing team."
** Spoiler ** Was totally enjoying happy movie until the affair storyline.
Just not my idea of a happy romantic comedy.
"Sadly, It was TOO sweet, flat and no character except for Ann Hathaway, well, being Ann Hathaway."
The acting duo of Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway is spectacular.
This movie tugs at your Heart strings.
"must see, great movie from start to finish."
Nothing special.
Kinda boring.
Not bad though
DeNiro is his usual charming best
Entertaining & funny!
"nothing special, still ok"
"Super cute, almost completely family friendly!"
Nice relationship movie.
RDN is brilliant.
Overall this movie was just okay.
"I liked most of the characters, but felt the movie was a little slow and a bit too long."
There are a few scenes in the movie that could be cut to make it a little faster paced.
Both my husband and I really enjoyed it.
Authentic timely story.
Great performances from all the actors.
Many laugh out loud relatable moments.
Wonderful acting.
What can I say but what a fantastically nice movie.
"Nothing amazing happens, excitement was left out when the screenplay was written."
"What you are delivered is 2 hours of positive affirmations from Robert DeNiro that he ""still has music left in him"" and Anne Hathaway looking, acting, succeeding and struggling like most of out generation and the issues in following your dreams and not being able to delegate."
The small and simple things in this movie make you smile on so many occasions that the characters jump out at you and you can't help but feel for them.
I had expectations for how the story would go and my only complaint is that it would have been good to see the results of all the advice he gave to the interns around the office while he was waiting for his email.
I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a nice calm and enjoyable movie with two fantastic actors who slip into characters as if they were already them.
This movie was great.
There was a great use of camera angles and symbolism.
The story was original with many plot twists making it all the more better.
"Being a feminist, I enjoyed seeing a woman in power and addressing the issues of feminism throuout the movie."
It really brought attention to an untraditional household and made the situation seem realistic and a good thing.
"However, there was one specific part in the movie that I couldn't stop thinking about."
"In one scene, Matt, Paige, Jules, and Ben are in the Ostin's kitchen when Paige tells her parents that Maddy doesn't want to be her friend anymore and Matt calls Maddy bipolar on account of the fact that every other day she is has an issue with Paige."
Children often have mood swings as they are trying to figure out how to deal with their emotions.
Bipolar disorder is not something to joke about because lots of people struggle with this very serious mental health issue.
I would highly suggest that the producers decide to edit out the few lines that have to do with calling Maddy bipolar as many people could take offense to it.
This is the only reason I did not give five stars.
"Other than that one scene, the movie was great and I highly recommend it!"
"Starts out pleasant and new, before quickly going on a tangent that leaves the viewer unsatisfied"
When you need the help of an old friend
Enjoyed this movie very much.
Both lead actors did a wonderful job.
"It was funny, sweet and entertaining."
I really enjoyed this movie
"Hay algo en Anne Hathaway o como se escriba que no termina de cuajarme, es una gran actriz pero la siento falsa, no me la compro... pero Robert De Niro, no recuerdo que me haya decepcionado en pel√≠cula alguna, y me flech√≥ con su papel de Pat Solatano en Silver Linings Playbook."
"√âchenle una miradita a esta pel√≠cula, no es para nada pretenciosa y se pasa un rato bien entretenido haci√©ndolo."
"¬øVerdad, Carlos?"
"Feel good movie, un poco melosa para mi gusto."
Surprisingly one of the funniest movies of the year
Unexpectedly awesome film.
"Sweet, predictable, likeable and Robert De Niro is awesome."
Very Entertaining!!
"I knew I'd like it, which lowered my expectations enough for me to love it."
"Very warm, full characters, fun banter, and feel good fuzzies."
Excellent movie!
Loved it!!
A great film.. Lots of heart and a great cast.
Does De Niro really need the money ?
Someone should tap him on the shoulder and stop him from getting involved in junk like this .
Very enjoyable movie!
Anne Hathaway and Robert DeNiro have a great chemistry!
this is a movie that people should see.
"its funny, some truth, and some more funny."
I liked it very much and DE Niro is still the best!!
"Movie is a great, inspiring and motivational for all ages!"
DeNiro got me.
I like him as actor but this turned out to be an awkward chick flick.
First let me say I really liked this movie.
There are a bunch of little things I have issues with in this movie.
One example is that a man who only retired 5 years ago as a VP of Sales didn't know how to turn on a computer.
The concept is that someone in there 70's has no clue about technology.
But that might have only been true 15 years ago.
There was also too much of unnecessary drama that was added that wasn't really needed.
Even with all these little issues it is a funny movie and very touching.
I really enjoyed it and you really cared about every person in the movie.
"Overall a good movie, just a lot of flaws."
"Surrounded by warmth, happiness and some surprising actions."
It is a story with a wasted potential but still enjoyable and sentiment evoking by De Niro's performance as well as a good laugh by the rest of the cast.
Critics sometimes miss the point of a film.
Sometimes a movie doesn't need to be deep and complex.
"Sometimes it needs to be real and warm, which is what The Intern is."
"It's somehow more ""honest"" than other similar films."
General likability and the chemistry between Anne Hathaway & Robert De Niro is unmatched.
This movie was funny and charming.
I would have rated it better if it wasn't for the ending...if you could even call it that - it was so abrupt.
Favorite this month.
better than I expected
Robert De Niro is great in this movie.
He plays a retired guy who accepts a new job as an intern.
He becomes Anne Hathaway assistent and best friend.
The movie provides laughs and also tears to the viewer.
Well-made movie!
Fantastic.
Old school gets a great hand here.
Pretty good for they type of movie that it is.
A feel good film that will please all the DeNiro and Hathaway fans.
Great date film.
Let me start off by saying that I love Robert De Niro.
"I am a huge fan of his, even if some of the recent movies he has starred in haven't been so good, I still think he is a great actor."
"Ok, now that, that is out of the way, let's get this review started."
The performances in The Intern are very good.
Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway have amazing chemistry in this film.
It's no Jake Gyllenhall and Michael Pena but it's still amazing.
Robert De Niro is very charming in this movie.
I'm not the biggest Anne Hathaway fan but she really did surprise me in this.
She was really good and really believable.
"The Intern is really funny, specifically a break-in scene that had me crying."
That scene was hilarious!
"I was debating whether to give this a 3.5 star rating but when I looked back on that scene, I knew I had to give it a 4 star."
The drama was really good too.
My only complaint was that it didn't know what it was trying to be.
Did it want to be a comedy or a drama?
"I'm not saying you can't have ""dramedy""."
"It just had me laughing at one point, then sad, then laughing, then sad again."
"Another complaint I had was the pacing, it wasn't very fast but it wasn't very slow."
There were a few scenes that dragged on for a bit to long and there were parts where I was checking my watch.
"There are a few boring/dull scenes here and there but for the most part, I had a blast watching this."
"It has a little bit of comedy, drama, and a lot of heart."
See it!
So AMAZING!!
Perfect cast!
Started out great but got gradually worse.
Super cute movie.
Nice little story line.
"Great acting, heart warming."
Don't let the so so reviews scare you.
This is a wonderful film.
Loved the life lessons DeNiro's character teaches everyone about chivalry & being a classy man.
Moms--bring your teen aged sons to this film!
"A great date film, or just feel good fix for anyone."
This movie made me feel so good.
"It was entertaining, funny, and with great performances."
I didn't like 1 arc of the story but the rest is very enjoyable.
DeNiro and Hathaway have great chemistry.
This was a refreshing uplifting movie.
It shows the value in every person... Young needs older and older brings light and insight to younger (people that is)!
"I've seen it 2x considering seeing it a 3rd time, as it leaves you happy and having faith in the world as a person that is somewhere in the middle of older and younger, it's a GREAT MOVIE!"
"The Intern has a strong sense of charm and likability not just on the Golden Globe worthy performances from De Niro and Hathaway themselves, but also on the chemistry they share on-screen."
B+
Wife and I liked this movie.
"Would recommend to go see if you like Robert D. and Ann H. Funny, warm hearted, good story line."
What an amazing movie.
"If you are an independent and successful woman, it shows the obstacles you will face if you also want to have a family."
Nancy Meyers was able to write a story better than to be just another movie.
"Just back from ""The Intern."""
Very enjoyable.
"Just a ""nice"" film; I don't mean that insultingly... it was just relentlessly... nice."
"Even when Anne Hathaway's character has a major crisis, it still wraps up in pretty much the nicest way possible."
"That being said, Hathaway and De Niro have great, weird chemistry together, and that's the enjoyable part of the film."
"De Niro is seemingly effortless in this, but it's a good effortless as opposed to some of his ""I'm phoning this in for the money"" type of ""effortless"" you see from him some times these days."
"In the end, it's a Nancy Meyers film... she has a certain style and it's probably not going to change."
"However, I really enjoyed watching both De Niro and Hathaway do their thing... good work by some of the supporting characters... sometimes that's just enough."
"RATING: 4/5 RT, 8/10 IMDB."
This was a fun very enjoyable date night move that I'd be willing to see again!
Very enjoyable movie.
If you want some good laughs go see this movie.
Funny movie great cast
Funny movie with some heart.
DeNiro and Hathaway are great!
Must see if you are over 50.
"Cute, if implausible."
It's a good movie as a rental but I wouldn't see it in the theater
Very refreshing.
I would see it again in a heartbeat.
So many laugh out loud moments.
Good movie that puts life into perspective for the young entrepreneur.
Robert De Niro does a great job as does Ann Hathway.
The critics are terrible at ratings.
Stick with the audience scores.
Excellent all around movie.
It was funny and entertaining the whole time.
Robert de Niro is hard not to love.
The only thing that amused me here is De Niro's acting
"Charming, pleasant, lazy script with several contrived plot points."
"Like cotton candy, sweet, but nothing really there."
"Liked it, wish I could have loved it."
"entertaining, good performances, however there is a timeline that can not overcome the barrier of boredom in total."
This is an incredibly fun movie.
I'm always a fan of Anne Hathaway and she does great in her role.
Di Niro is a true star though in this film and he really brings the storytelling to life.
The film is a feel-good movie that showcases some great life lessons and thoughts.
I enjoyed the movie thoroughly and suggest that everyone give this movie a chance and enjoy it for it's humour and sentiment.
a great movie.
Heartfelt and inspiring.
"It's a cute, harmless, little movie, with great leading performances that elevate the otherwise generic material."
Real chick flick but Bobby deniro is terrific
"Not without its faults, but I was engrossed in the story and characters from start to finish."
This was a solid film to escape into.
"Funny, endearing, and a great story with many messages."
"Cute story, great chemistry between Hathaway and De Niro!"
"Very funny, touching and interesting take on what it means to be a man and a woman in the 21st century."
"The Intern was a feel good movie, funny at times but boring at others."
"De Niro and Hathaway do an excellent job , but the acting in other minor roles was unimpressive."
"It's worth seeing, but nothing spectacular."
"Amazing script, cast, visuals and music!"
Critics prove they're idiots again!
wonderful feel good flick without clich√©d plotline
Probably the best feel good movies of the year.
I mean..what's the purpose?
Seems like throwing a message that interns should do things even private even not paid tho..
every startup could use an intern like DeNiro.
This was a cute movie that appeals to the young and the old!
Extremely entertaining & very funny
All around good movie!
I LOVED this film.
I cant wait to see it again!
This film made me borderline homicidal.
Most reviews are accurate.
"Promising premise isn't fulfilled by a rather pedestrian plot, but the chemistry of Hathaway and Di Nero are worth the ticket."
"Clever set up-- contrasting old and new business models, old and new management styles, detours into a soapy treatment of the young female executive's family life."
The hard driving executive devolves into just another weepy female Makes you wonder what they could have done with a really well done script.
Cast was very good and I enjoyed the story better then I expected to.
surprised I liked it a lot.
Going to movies is like watching our dreams come true....
"Thanks to the leads promising acting, it feels like everything can co-exist in this world...."
De Niro and Hathaway have some of the best chemistry in recent memory.
Their friendship is endearing to watch and easy to root for.
What an entertaining movie!
very respectful of working moms and seniors.
"Plenty of laughs, Loved it."
No academy awards here but lots of fun.
"I had little to no expectations going into THE INTERN, but boy was I pleasantly surprised after leaving the theater."
THE INTERN is a happy and incredibly enjoyable time at the movies.
"With a pretty simple premise, De Niro and Hathaway shine as these two lovable characters in an unconventional situation."
Hathaway is a young CEO of a start-up internet clothing store that simply wants to please everyone.
Her busy schedule and lack of business experience make it difficult to manage all of the responsibilities as CEO and a mother.
The performance by Hathaway manages o show this so you can't help but like her.
This type of progressive character is need more in film.
Women being the breadwinner is becoming more and more popular and society and this character portrays it very well.
"As good as Hathaway is in THE INTERN, Robert De Niro shines the brightest as the 70 year old intern."
His portrayal of Ben Whitaker is what made him one of the most lovable characters in recent film.
He does whatever it takes to make everyone's day better around him.
De Niro's surprising chemistry with Hathaway is what makes this movie fun.
On screen these two actually feel like best friends and even like father and daughter.
They both help better each other over the course of the movie and do it in a way which seems natural and unforced.
"All in all, with a simple story, the chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro create a feel-good and happy movie that is an overall good time at the movies."
(3.75/5)
What you'd expect - a nice feel good comedy that's a nice way to pass the time.
It's nice.
"Great casting, great story, great acting."
A enjoyable movie.
I would see it again.
"Loved it, lots of emotions, like a rollercoaster."
"Good date night movie, not to chick-flick, not a love story, just a human story."
Excellent tail of personal journey and self revelation
Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro were awesome.
The whole cast was great.
"Warm, heartfelt and funny."
A must see.
I would recommend it to anyone.
You won't be disappointed.
"Not anything ground breaking, but thoroughly Enjoyable."
"You didn't want to miss anything, just like in an action film."
Anne Hathaway really showed her Stuff in one scene in particular.
"I don't know how many ""takes"" there were, but I can't picture anyone being able to stop, start over, stop, start over, when it came to nailing this scene."
Robert De Niro was great.
The Focker character was so painful to watch I stopped halfway through the second one as an HBO movie on TV and never watched it again.
"It was good to see him in something ""watchable"" again."
he played the subtlety of the role quite well.
I hope there's a sequel so we can see what happens to these charcters.
Now that's a sign of a good movie.
Pretty good show but a lot of gay men.
Really a great movie!!!!
"Fresh an Anne Hathaway, obviously."
"Lo nuevo de la directora Nancy Meyers es una de las comedias m√°s divertidas y entra√±ables del a√±o, toda una grata sorpresa."
"Contando la historia de un hombre retirado que se inscribe en un programa de pasantes mayores en una empresa de ropa por internet, con el objetivo de darle sentido a su vida de nuevo."
"La qu√≠mica entre Robert de Niro y Anne Hathaway es magia pura en pantalla, logrando personajes bastante entra√±ables y haciendo que la historia funcione perfectamente, incluso me atrever√≠a a decir que ambos o por lo menos Mr. De Niro lograran la nominaci√≥n al Globo de Oro."
"A pesar de que ellos sostienen la cinta, los dem√°s personajes no son mal aprovechados y cada uno tiene su momento para brillar, incluyendo a Rene Russo con un divertido personaje."
"The Intern cumple todo lo que propone, es fresca y es muy divertida, algo que se agradece mucho y que los amantes del genero disfrutaran."
I absolutely loved this movie!!!!!
Hathaway and de Niro compliment each other perfectly
Worst movie I've seen in a long time.
Waaaaaaay too long for the type of movie.
"And Robert DiNero, the whole reason anyone would want to see the movie, was just a boring character with no real flaws."
His character just seemed so complacent.
And why must they give Anne Hathaway all these weird quirks that just don't correlate with the movie.
"Surprisingly enjoyable - I had no intention on seeing this one, but did and am glad that I went."
DeNiro is charming as the old guy sharing his wisdom with a beautiful Hathaway.
They did a nice job with a relatively simple story.
Nancy Meyers is one of the only filmmakers whose movies I let slide when they are cliched and overwrought.
The Intern is probably Meyers' worst film but I still had an enjoyable time with it.
Maybe that's why I let Meyers get away with so much: her sense of earnestness is incredibly endearing.
Hathaway and De Niro are great.
"so loved this movie, awesome acting, perfect chemistry, funny, heart warming"
Robert De Nero and Anne Hathaway as usual were great and The Intern has been one of the best movies of 2015 I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good comedy.
"Not bad, weird interaction between the couple at the end."
But cool
"Probably, the most heartwarming story line of the year, connecting the young to the old."
"Rather like its protagonist, a surprisingly smart and sentimental story."
Actors were great.
Great feel good movie?
A good chuckle.
Liked it.
I was pleasantly entertained
For me it was totally enjoyable.
Critics don't always know best.
Loved it and Robert aced it again.
"The relationship between De Niro and Hathaway was spot on and I recommend it if you want laughter, drama and a great message."
But the ending could of been written better.
"Anne Hathaway plays a role reminiscent of the movie ""The Devil Wears Prada"" with her being a young employee with a much older boss."
"This movie is the reversal; her a young boss with a much older employee, The Intern."
The movie overall has a good tone to it and makes you laugh every so often.
"*SPOILER* On the contrast, much of the movie lacked any real plot that meets the casting."
Some of the story lines that are introduced are never revisited and don't leave you feeling satisfied with them.
"For example one of the younger male employees is in love with Anne Hathways characters receptionist, they visit this story a couple times, but never put it to rest."
Another example would be her relationship with her mom.
"Definitely a ""date"" movie, or a movie to watch with your mom... Anne and DeNiro are solid as always job and have a nice charm, but overall movie lacks substance."
it was a good soulful movie to make you think of the person that came to your life and be your best friend
Very good movie!!
would love to see more movies like this!
Great movie with a very smart script/writing.
Wife and I really enjoyed it!
Humorous look at the changing generational nuances of life.
Hathaway & De Niro shine throughout.
The Intern was a refreshing piece of cinema that dealt with the realities of ageism (specifically in the workplace) in a humorous and charming way.
"The plot was well thought out, well acted, and entertaining."
The overarching ideas of feminism and the wisdom of those older than us were well delivered.
"It was truly a pleasure to see a movie that made me both laugh and cry, something I have not experienced in quite some time from a single movie."
"Not only will I be purchasing The Intern when it is released, but it has earned the coveted title of ""A favorite movie"" of mine."
De Niro is genuinely adorable.
"That's pretty much the highlight of Nancy Meyer's The Intern, a fluffy dramedy about a 70-year-old widower working for Anne Hathaway as an intern."
"It's not terrible, and there were a couple of moments that made me chuckle."
But it is way too long (could've been at least 10 minutes shorter) and doesn't have a proper ending.
"De Niro is absolutely charming, and the mix of comedy and drama works well, but in the end very forgettable and generic."
it was incredible very humorous I laughed I cried it moved me Bob
What a beautiful movie.
Enjoyed it immensely
I thought this was a very realistic portrayal of how generations can relate and benefit from each other.
"Casting was perfect, especially De Niro and Hathaway."
I was apprehensive about seeing it because I'm not a huge Ann Hathaway and I thought that it'd be a knockoff of the Devil Wears Prada.
I was totally wrong.
The beginning of Hathaway and de Niro's relationship seemed like it was heading down the Prada slope but it turns into a beautiful relationship that has depth to it.
I wholeheartedly encourage that you see this movie because it is just delightful!
fantastic movie with great cast absolute winner
"As good as I hoped it would be, Nancy Meyers movies are never bad."
De Niro and Hathaway have great chemistry and the supporting cast is great.
Great story and delivery
Loved the storyline!
Robert DeNero and Anne Hathaway had wonderful chemistry.
"""Heartfelt and funny, a film I could never get bored of."
It was a pleasant New York City based film.
"I'm finally a full fan of Ms. Hathaway, she has my heart."
"Mr. De Niro, I have never seen him so precious in a film."
"Please go see this movie, it will turn your day around if you're in a slump."""
Charming story; excellent acting especially 2 main characters.
So refreshing to see the significance of a senior citizens perspective on life contributing to the healing and understanding of a young family.
"It was a good movie, but I wasn't a big fan."
"I love me some Anne Hathaway, but this movie just didn't do it for me"
This movie was amazing.
I loved every minute of it!!!
Not highbrow but good entertainment - I really enjoyed it!
"Very interesting, a lovable movie that will go to the heart and a little comedy that you will laugh your butts off at."
Lost its way!
"Could've been another Devil Wears Prada, but it went from focusing on the elderly intern, to delving into the female CEO's relationship... unnecessary!"
This had the added turn off of turning DeNiro's character into a sap.
Shame!
"Funny movie, but dragged on & the ending was pretty bad"
"Nancy Meyers has made a couple of films I have enjoyed, the now fairly forgotten What Women Want, where she got a good performance from Mel Gibson and paired him with an inform Helen Hunt, and then her following film, Something's Gotta Give, where she generated great energy from Jack Nicholson, but also went one better by pairing him with a fantastic Diane Keaton."
"Her next film, It's Complicated, featured a great performance from Meryl Streep (well, that's expected) but an over the top Alec Baldwin and a series of terrible supporting characters ruined the film."
"After a long layoff, she's back, and this time she's dragged more energy out of Robert De Niro than many of his recent performances."
De Niro is great with comedy and he plays it very well throughout.
"The humour is not an endless series of 'he's old, he doesn't understand the youngsters and their technology' and they certainly don't try to weave in any romance between him and Hathaway (thank God)."
"But the jokes are consistent and the plot moves along briskly, and deals with just enough depth to lift it above many films of a similar style."
"Of the rest of the cast, Hathaway is excellent, and like De Niro, effortless."
"There's a good performance (all be it occasional) from Rene Russo, and the supporting men surrounding De Niro are all fine."
"However, Holm feels a bit miscast as the husband."
"He suits the role early as the stay at home dad playing with the daughter, however, in the final act of the movie, he doesn't bring enough depth to the character to hold the weight the scenes required."
Brilliant!
"Funny, interesting and overall very entertaining."
"Average and cheesy in parts, DeNiro treads new ground portraying a patient and warm character, nothing special."
OK watch.
"Gooey, sentimental, and much too long."
"But hey, I liked it."
"Hathaway and De Niro will raise your spirits, and the film's feminist angle - while not particularly fleshed out - remains a refreshing touch."
The Intern is a movie with a premise that hooked me from the first time I saw a trailer.
The idea of 70-year-old Robert De Niro working as an intern at a young up-and-coming business run by Anne Hathaway was great.
"Thankfully they didn't spend much time on explaining the logic of why they were seeking employees that old, so it just got things rolling early without too much exposition."
This is where the movie got my hopes up.
"It cut right to his hiring pretty quickly, but then it took almost half the movie before De Niro started to have any significant interactions with Hathaway."
"I thought the movie would be a great look at how the wisdom of our elders can be a valuable tool in the modern workplace, but he doesn't provide as much guidance as I was expecting."
"There were certainly moments that met my expectations, but they were few and far between."
I actually started to wonder why Hathaway's character grew attached to him at all.
"I also felt they spent way too much time with Hathaway's family, which was the weaker aspect of the movie."
I think I know what Nancy Meyers was trying to do (talk about how people still tend to belittle strong working women) but that wasn't the message I expected to be delivered by The Intern.
"Also, because she intended to focus on that message, it would undermine her strength as a character if De Niro did anything of significance to ""save"" her."
So the theme she was striving for ended up undermining the main premise of the plot.
"It's a sweet enough movie to watch, and I enjoyed parts of it, but it fell short of my expectations."
"De Niro and Hathaway have strong chemistry and likability, unfortunately the script keeps veering into goofy melodrama."
"Extremely enjoyable, funny and entertaining.The chemistry between de Niro and Hathaway is absorbing."
Did not notice the time passing.
rRobert de Niro is brilliant as the old school gentlemen.
It's a must watch.
The critics are so critical!!
"This plot has a very current theme, deals with challenges we all face, and is charmingly directed and acted."
it was great I think it was a very happy and heart felt movie
Clever and well acted without requiring a willing suspension of disbelief
"Fun storyline...but, I couldn't buy into the actor playing the husband role."
Wonderful feel good movie!
I saw it with my middle-aged father and he also loved it.
Hathaway and DeNiro have perfect chemistry.

"awesome, best comedy I've seen in a long time."
A very touching and inspiring movie.
Enjoyable fluff from De Niro and Hathaway
"Nice idea, poor execution."
Male characters all too stereotypical.
"Thought the De Niro character would come through much stronger, but turns out he was just another weak male in a cast of male non-performers."
Ann Hathaway was excellent; the only worthwhile performance.
Music made me want to barf.
Saw it twice - really good
A breath of fresh air in the chick flick genre!
"I was happy to see most of the cliche troupes were nowhere to be found, however, one troupe did rear its ugly head and derailed all the emotion the film had built which lead to a deflated ending... would definitely watch a sequel!"
Meandering story line never finds any substance.
A drag.
DeNiro is relegated to playing a Mary Worth character who offers fatherly comfort to a driven entrepeneur.
Straight up hiarious!
Just for Bobby.
(nice) chick flick.
Such a great movie :D
hillourus and smart :)
Feel Good kinda movie
Lovely feel good film well acted.
"Good movie but not much story there - good acting, nice idea but it needed more substance to get 4 or 5 stars...usually love Nancy Meter films but this one is a little short on interesting story."
"My mom made me see it and while I'm not a huge fan of Anne Hathaway, I found her much more tolerable than Robert De Niro's neutered performance as Ben, the likable (debatable) intern."
"That said, De Niro was unrecognizable in this performance which is actually quite impressive."
Still better than Reindeer Games.
Fuck Reindeer Games.
It started OK but seemed to get silly.Could have been much better
"A feel good movie that pushes all the right buttons, without being cloying or derivative."
Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway are spot on in their roles.
I enjoyed it very much!
Really fantastic movie.
"My husband, my 15 year old son, and I loved it."
Really worth your time to go see.
Anne Hathaway is your go to man for your pro feminist workaholic role.
Unusually lengthy movie.
No charecter was intense enough to take the main role.
Just a light watch.
Easily forgettable.
As always Dinero was excellent!
"If your a Robert Deniro fan, you'll love this movie."
Good family Movie and couples type.
"""THE INTERN"" is a heart warming tale of friendship and light comedy."
De Niro is playing an aged gentleman.
Meyer's film would have worked better if he had shot someone.
Lovable film #chickflick
unexpectedly good.
lots of fluent humor and really touching parts.
Robert DiNero and Ann Hathaway were great together.
You will really like this movie.
DeNiro and Hathaway are great together and like able.
The rest of cast is great as well.
"The story is always moving forward, which doesn't always happen with movies in this genre."
This is one of Nancy Meyers better movies.
I would definitely watch this one again.
"A good picture to take your parents to, unless your parents have good taste in movies."
"It wasn't a train wreck, DeNiro and Hathaway made sure of that."
It was just empty-headed fluff.
"I didn't want to get up and leave, I'll give it that."
Hilarious and not too heavy.
Sleeper hit.
Good acting....great topic......just weak and slow at points Robert De Niro so good.
Great movie with a good story and good actors.
Fun watch.
Great chemistry.
"Although I'm normally raving about some shoot-em-up, kick-butt action film or unbelievable property destruction movie each week, I really enjoyed ""The Intern."""
I felt like I smiled throughout the entire movie.
De Niro and Hathaway were both incredible as well as several other well-known actors with smaller roles.
I can't believe the critics gave it such a low score.
"Oh well, who cares what they think."
I highly recommend it.
"This wasn't the most exciting film I have ever seen, nor the funniest."
However it did have a certain charm to it.
"The leads, Anne Hathaway and Robert De Nero, have great chemistry."
A nice film but not an amazing one.
Very charming and funny.
The acting and chemistry of Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway is great.
I'm so used to seeing De Niro play a rough character that it was such a treat to see him play a feel-good role.
There is substantial humor for the most part of the film until *semi-spoiler* it takes a more serious tone towards the second half of the film.
I recommend it if you want to watch a feel-good comedy movie that touches on perseverance and independence.
(10/17/15) Edwards 10
"This movie has funny aspects throughout the two hours, however there's no story to follow and therefore you don't have any attachment to a character which becomes boring after half an hour."
If you're looking for a chilled out movie that you don't need to pay attention too then this is the movie for you... p.s I've only watched the trailer.
The Intern gets one thing seriously right: the casting of Robert DeNiro.
"He puts this movie on his shoulders and runs to daylight, milking the best of scenes with expression and nuance."
"He had me from the first scene, and what a pleasure it was to watch him with Renee Russo as they steal the show."
Not a fan of Anne Hathaway and nothing she does here will add to her Oscar hopes.
See this one for the veterans; it's one of DeNiro's best performances.
"Fantastic, loved every minute."
"It's not often I get the kind of emotional truth in a movie where I feel like I should leave the room because I'm intruding on the characters, but I felt that way in this movie."
It was funny and emotional without being trite and completely subverts expectations.
"Set my expectations real low and allowed myself to fully enjoy the film for the nice, light treat that it is."
It is very hard for me to give a Deniro comedy a shot but he is quite good in this film as is Anne Hathaway.
I ain't no Hatha-hater.
"I really like her on screen warmth and here she is strong, smart and vulnerable."
"Only wish the ""heist"" scene wasn't in the film."
"Sure, it got good laughs in the theater but it seemed a little cheap and out of character for those involved."
We need more of these type of movies.
Just saw the movie yesterday.
It's funny and real and different.
Love Rober de Niro.
Harmless fluff anchored by a very likeable performance from Robert De Niro.
Great and uplifting movie.
With a great storyline.
Outstanding film.
"Great story, great acting."
Left really happy that I chose to see this movie.
YAWN --- so little substance in this trite bland movie.
I was utterly disappointed that the DeNIro character did not have anything really worthwhile to teach the entrepreneur boss played by Ann Hathaway.
I would see it again on Netflix but would not even rent it on DVD.
"Cute,one of those frustrating movies whereby the trailer, which shows it to be this fun romp - is not exactly true."
"Way more of a downer on many levels, but Hathaway and DeNiro make it watchable."
"Refreshing, heartwarming movie!"
"Anne Hathaway and Robert Deniro, going into it is kind of like maybe."
Anne Hathaway was exactly what you would expect.
She was a strong independent woman who just needed a little push.
"Robert Deniro is the one I found myself incredibly impressed with, and I'm not entirely sure why."
I think I expected myself to fall in love with Anne Hathaway's character and I couldn't because of how phenomenal Deniro's was.
I'm really glad that I took the time to see this movie.
It was definitely one where I came out of the movie feeling better than when I went in.
Robert De Niro was great in this movie!
Nice to see him in this type of role!
Was a genuine sweet movie.
"It was good, and that gives it three stars."
"You can predict what's going to happen, but all the same your happy with the outcome."
Not a bad movie at all.
"a cute, amusing, funny, adorable, and even uplifting story as we watch co workers build a father daughter like friendship"
"Funny, well written, enjoyable."
Plenty of laughs.
Heartwarming and fun.
Feel good movie - Much needed
"Refreshing, good for young adults and seniors."
Best movie I have seen this year
"It's an ok movie, not great but not horrible."
"Nancy, oh Nancy, ci fosse un tuo film, dico uno, che non mi sia piaciuto."
"Un hombre retirado,viudo y en sus 70's, Ben ( Robert De NIro) decide reincorporarse como pasante de una empresa de modas liderada por una joven ejecutiva, Jules ( Anne Hathaway)."
"Jules, reticente en un primer momento a contar con un pasante de edad avanzada, encontrar√† en Ben un aliado valioso para sus proyectos y un amigo leal."
"Bastante tierna, inteligente y divertida."
A bit saccharine.
But I went with it.
FANTASTIC movie!!!!
"It was heart-warming, funny & it sure shows how much society relies on technology with everything."
SO GLAD I went to see it in theaters than just waiting for it to come out on videos!!!
"When you look at Robert De Niro, you picture him as a tough, smart ""Mafia-like"" type of character."
This movie showed him as the opposite.
"But when you think of Anne Hathaway, you don't see her as a control-freak, powerful, career-driven like woman."
"This movie shows her just as that, but it was a very family-friendly/oriented movie."
"""2 thumbs'-up!!!"
I loved this happy feel good movie!!
Loved this movie!
Just pure enjoyment from the beginning to the end!
I love Robert Deniro so much!
A movie that you leave feeling like you want to be a better friend.
"I can watch Anne Hathaway anytime, but I really enjoyed De Niro, too."
The comedy poking fun at young tech employees made me laugh out loud several times.
Good acting along with a good story for once.
"Funny, charming, and heartfelt, The Intern doesn't fall into the typical conventions of its genre and provides a genuine story lead by two incredible actors that have a surprisingly natural and wonderful chemistry."
I was disappointed in the end--it seems to me that Jules was just as responsible as Matt for their troubles and that didn't seem to be acknowledged enough.
"Otherwise, a great movie."
BA
"Ending was weird, but overall not bad."
Its a heart warming film!
Has some smart comedy.
"good movie, not great but good."
"Held my attention, a little slow, with a predictable outcome."
great actors so it's impossible to give it a bad rating.
would have rather seen it at home.
great movie!
Anna and Robert has good chemistry in it!
"Another unrealistic, yet enjoyable Nancy Meyers joint."
"I enjoyed this emotional roller coaster with punches I saw coming, but it was nice and the actors seemed to be having a good time."
The ending left me wanting more of a resolution.
I liked Robert DeNiro from the moment the movie began.
"Anne Hathaway, too."
"They quickly captured my interest, and held it throughout the movie."
"Entertaining, touching, fun movie."
Best movie I've seen in a while.
Never thought I would say that the chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Robert Dinero worked and was easy and believable.
Two great actors taking a simple and somewhat sophomoric plot and making it thought provocing and very entertaining.
Went in expecting normalcy and left with a small tear in my eye.
"This was a movie I probably wouldn't have seen and I KNOW my husband wouldn't have seen it - he didn't say anything, but I knew and he said as much afterwards."
So how come we went we had 3 Groupons to use within 5 days and only a few to pick from so we picked The Intern and are we ever glad we did.
My husband leaned over and said it's a good thing you listened to me and came.
We were both laughing so hard very early into the movie.
"Delightful story, wonderful cast, great acting, what's not to like."
"Go, you'll enjoy it!"
"this was a funny film and a happy story, nice film"
One of the best I've seen yet this year!
"Great entertainment, love DiNero."
Very funny but kind of left you hanging at the end.
Worth seeing.
"It started out good but ended up being so I'm unnecessarily long, that it ruined the movie!"
"Also, most of the acting was pretty terrible!"
Especially the roll of the lead singers husband!
I truly enjoyed this movie.
I highly recommend it!
√∞??
A pleasant and unconventional love story.
Ah one of those feel good films I suppose.
A bit like 'The Devil Wears Prada' but a bit more nice.
Everyone has problems and in the end everyone get a resolution and find balance in their lives.
"I would give it a 4 but, there was something a bit slow in this film, I just didn't feel there was a climax to the story, the middle and then denouement and just yey."
"Not particularity funny or exciting, but not bad."
Great film of the times though: what with stay at home dad and the whole start up company and all.
De Niro como siempre en cualquier papel es excelente!
"Lazy script, lazy acting."
Plot is half-assed.
Hathaway and DeNiro - obviously both capable of incredible acting - are wasted in this film.
Husband was very miscast.
This movie is awesome all up until the last half hour where she sets a terrible example for young teens and adults who are going to see this movie I don't know how they got Anne Hathaway to agree to that twist.
But besides this it was a great movie.
This is a harmless movie.
"No bad language, no nudity, but not a snooze-fest either."
"Cute, but a little mushy."
Probably something that would be good for adult children to see with their parents.
I think the critics were a little tough on this movie.
"I thought it was warm, funny, and had a pretty great message."
A cute and heart warming film with a star studded cast.
Though mostly appealing to the average young couple's date night and anyone over the age of 60.
"It may not explore all of its plot points completely, but thanks to Nancy Meyers' light dialogue, perfect cast, and and amusing premise, The Intern still comes off as thoroughly appealing."
Worst movie ever.
"Nobody laughed at all and I literally heard like five people in the theatre say ""This sh*t blows horse d*ck""."
There was a noisy bunch behind my seat and halfway through the movie I stopped feeling my seat be kicked and turned around and saw... HALF THE FUCKING THEATRE GONE.
THATS HOW SH*T THIS BORING A*S MOVIE IS.
How is this a thing?
How can one market in cinema when they call A FUCKING DOCUMENTARY ON OLD PEOPLE A COMEDY.
Save your f*cking hourly salary because flipping patties for an hour is not worth wasting another 2 watching this pungent sh*t stank.
Very pleasantly surprised!
The movie was incredibly enjoyable and very entertaining.
predictable but charming.
the 1st movie i haven't disliked de Niro in
"Although it is unoriginal and a little predictable, the humour and likeability of its two stars makes this a very watchable movie."
"A slow moving, unexpectedly sweet story with strong performances bu De Nero and Hathaway."
I'd forgotten how quirky and charming she could be.
Charming in places but overlong with entire scenes that could be cut.
Some noticeably bad writing in places that's trying just too hard to make characters sound young and hip.
Plus a 2nd act that doesn't really go anywhere.
Though DeNiro and Hathaway are good company.
I'd watch it again if I had too :) Loved the mixed feelings and HER STRENGTH to overcome everything...
"Great storyline, lol all through the movie."
"This is a really good date movie, and quite endearing."
It's successful because of the strengths of both main actors.
"While not exactly a fan of its feministic overtones, it does at least leave room for interpretation."
"It's a refreshing take of the old school vs new school business ethic and atmosphere, but the pacing is a little awkward at times."
"Still, my wife and I (who are really the generation in between these two worlds) enjoyed it very much."
"I saw ""The Intern"" last Sunday at the CMC Rolling Hills 20."
It was another good and really cute movie from Nancy Meyers.
"Great acting (Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway)."
Very fun!
Great chemistry between all actors & actresses!
"I laughed, I cried!"
Must see!
This is a must see for anyone over 65.
Great acting!
"Fun natured, interesting, good time movie."
Deniro is fantastic in this one.
I'd say it's probably his best since Meet the Parents and his most lovable character ever.
Hathaway is fine too but Deniro is the reason to see it.
This movie also has one of the best scenes of the year.
The laptop heist scene!
"Such a heart tugging film, it's completely not what I expected it to be and I can't recommend it enough!"
"It made me laugh, cry, feel anger and sadness."
Beautiful movie!
My husband and I went on date night and it was a good movie I laughed and I got a bit emotional.
But I really enjoyed the movie.
I asked him he hat he thought and he liked it as well.
I got to give it a 5
Pretty good.
Better than I expected
cute movie.
It keeps insisting that the boss is hard to get along with but she seems rather easy.
I stead of confronting an employee that she doesn't want around.her she gets her second in command to take care of it.
"The tired old dilemma of a woman 'wanting it all"" is also played."
I'm sure the producers patted themselves on the back for having a house husband but then the main character deals with crisis solely because she is a woman.
Maybe if Hollywood quit shoving the concept.down our throats people would stop believing women have to make choices that men don't.

Bastante fresca y agradable
"Light and predictable, easy viewing."
"The Intern is warm, bright, and lovable."
Hathaway and De Niro had great chemistry along with all the secondary characters in this movie.
However this movie get's 4.5 because the ending was a bit abrupt and although a lot of things wrapped up it just would've been nice to see a nice epilogue rather than just end-blackout.
"Nancy Meyers showcases a startup, the city through a rose tinted frame and easy on the eye Anne Hathaway."
Very funny.
Deniro is clearly the star.
Hathaway and deniro are good on screen together.
The ending seemed lazy though.
But definitely worth the money!
You critics expect too much.
"It was a good plot, relevant to today, no F words, no violence, funny, with emotionally satisfying micro-events."
And good actors.
"Great film, lots of laughs."
"Very good, very entertaining, Robert was very funny and Ann was a typical CEO."
Different story line.
"It was entertaining, the relationship between the two of them was good though the hotel scene bordered on inappropriate."
A feel good movie with a very inspiring performance by Robert de Niro.
And Anne Hathaway is as adorable as ever.
"More Rom than Com, not what I was expecting"
Funny and charming.
Another triumph for director Nancy Meyers.
"Robert de Niro es un actor que parece haber decidido cambiar de giro art√≠stico en los √∫ltimos 15 a√±os, y esta pel√≠cula sera recordada como la menos embarazosa para el actor."
"Una comedia que no reta al espectador, no empalaga ni sorprende, sin embargo puede llegar a tocar un par de botones de espectadores espec√≠ficos."
"Quintessential Nancy Meyers film, a bit schmaltzy but oh so likeable."
Anyone who has worked a startup will relate to the setup and De Niro's character is like the older mentor that some of us were fortunate enough to have had.
"A topical film for modern times, sweet and a little messy at the same time."
"Good story, good acting, good flow, a little of this, a little of that."
"The Intern pourrait √™tre un film d'une b√™tise hallucinante avec ses personnages unidimensionnels (De Niro est gentil, Hathaway est stress√©e...) mais le sc√©nario du film refuse tellement tout forme de cynisme qu'il est impossible de ne pas y trouver une forte √©motion devant cette histoire simple d'amiti√© platonique entre un homme √¢g√© qui cherche √† se rentre √† nouveau utile et une jeune workaholic."
"Robert de Niro est excellent dans un contre-emploi qui rend parfaitement hommage √† son talent, tandis qu'Anne Hathaway est moins insupportable qu'√† l'accoutum√©e."
"Vraiment, The Intern est une jolie surprise."
The cast is amazing and does a great job of keeping you intrigued.
I really enjoyed this movie!
"Lovely film, gentle, humorous, nice."
"Great characters, but weaker on plot, especially the ending (loose ends not wrapped up)."
But thoroughly enjoyable.
De Niro fabulous.
Chick flick?
Absolutely.
I'd actually put it in the category of chick flicks guys can like too.
The whole movie is showing role reversals in 2015 and does a really good job of avoiding cliches.
Thought it was a great movie!!
realy sweet funny movie.
Totally pleasant filmgoing
We need more stories like this showing interaction between the generations and how each can learn and grow from being around the other.
DeNiro and Hathaway were perfect in their respective roles....
"was a very good movie, de niro was great"
Good Sunday kleenex movie.
"Awesome movie, laughed out loud more than once, very entertaining and just hilarious, Robert Dinero was great!!"
Really good feel good movie !
!!
Super funny and cool :) a great change from the usual films
The most emotionally compelling film I've watched in a long time.
A+ todas las Emociones en una sola pelicula.
right in the feels!!
"I thought this movie was going to be great, but I was surprised how great this movie actually was!"
loses half a star for a screw-up at the end.
but I laughed too much to punish it
Tres bon film a regarder avec tendre moit√É¬©e!
Was lots of fun to watch ...good afternoon at the movies
Best movie I've seen in a very long time.
Love the old school ways!
I don't hand out 5/5s very often.
"In fact, hardly at all."
I had zero problems with this movie.
The Intern is nothing short of wonderful.
Great acting.
Several funny moments.
Just an overall good feeling movie.
Solid performances
Not even the amazing Anne Hathaway could save a script without any intrigue or storyline.
"Nancy Meyers, you can do better."
I don't usually like chick flicks but I loved this one.
Adorable and funny and smart and heart-warming.
"(Thank God Reese Witherspoon quit the project due to conflict schedule, she would have ruined this)"
Audience applauded at the end.
"Great cast, script, direction, photography, production, and wonderful fun.it is not predicticible, nor does it fall into a set category."
Both leads are in top form.
Go see it.
I will go again.
The only reason my sister and I went to see this movie was because Martian was full.
We were pleasantly surprised with how funny and heartwarming this movie is.
I highly recommend seeing this movie.
"It is interesting, funny, not draggy."
I wouldn't even mind seeing it again.
It was a good film for date night.
Love this movie!
I will see it again!!
Very lovely!
A celebration of good old fashioned principles for living.
"Very cute and funny, may even bring a few tears."
Great Date Movie.
"Funny, thoughtful and on point for today."
Even better than I expected.
The cinematic equivalent of a night in with friends with wine.
Comfortable and warming.
http://ppcorn.com/us/intern-film-review/
Good story line along with good acting made for an enjoyable night out.
Loved the comparison between old school business and new school.
"The intern is a confusing movie, both in its (and i hesitate to use this term for fear of shitstorm) gender politics, its slant on experience and the bizarre likability of its two leads."
"It often shoots, it often misses but overall it is quite endearing and enjoyable."
Director Nancy Meyers has been responsible for some of the more cringeworthy 'woman movies' hits including the atrocious 'What women want' but here she turns her eyes towards 'surrogate father' relationships.
"Because let's not mince words, this is what the Intern is."
"Real 'man's man' DeNiro is contrasted to the way these 'manchildren playing videogames these days' are, they dress like slobs, can't talk to women and don't carry pocket squares."
"DeNiro is a bastion of old masculinity, an embodiment of the middle class america of youre and he becomes endearing to the millennial hipster crowd by sheer can-do-ness and seriousness."
Kids these days amirite?
"And in that process he becomes a surrogate masculine figure for quirky, overworked, overachieving start-up founder Hathaway."
"And this is where the politics get confusing, at least for me as a man with sympathies for feminism."
"Hathaway is a female Steve Jobs: precise, wealthy through her own merits and workaholic."
She is also quite opposed to boys business club masculinity.
"But still once she gets DeNiro as an intern she is all about leaning on him as a father figure and an emblem of the father-knows-best men of yore (who knows, for instance that she needs to eat when she doesn't, or that she had too much to drink or knows both on-line advertising/sales AND the streets of Brooklyn better etc.)."
"DeNiro is the opposite of a manic pixie dream girl, he is a Calm Progressive Dream Grandpa, the intangible but eminently crush-able strong, supportive man that checks all the boxes."
"Fortunately, unless you're a critical asshole, this is all not extremely noticeable, because the leads have mad chemistry together."
"DeNiro is enjoyable, believable and likeable for the first time in ages and Hathaway is... well great."
"She cranks it up to 100 and creates a complex character in work and family life and jives stunnigly well with DeNiro's respectful, helpful grandpa."
The supporting cast of ditzy hipsters is these for a couple of laughs including a rather cringeworthy 'heist' scene that seemed tacked on.
"But then again, with the exception of Something's gotta give (and even there the humour wobbles) director meyers never could do comedy and was over and over saved by the strength of the cast."
Except in What women want cause fuck that movie.
"So, yeah, the Intern is appealing and endearing, even if it misfires quite a bit."
"But if you want to see DeNiro in a good role or Hathaway once more, go see it."
10/10 would recommend.
Just excellent all around.
"The acting was superb, and the story pulled at every emotion a bit."
Good show.
"This movie was a guilty pleasure for me, I enjoyed it a lot can't deny it!"
"A perfectly cute, harmless movie."
"Don't need to see it in theaters, but worth your time to see sometime."
"Very good cast, and nobody phones it in."
"Thanks to the chemistry of the two superstars in The Intern, DeNiro and Hathaway, The Intern is a likable movie."
"The story itself is flawed, yes, but DeNiro and Hathaway have excellent chemistry and create two great characters."
"What I enjoy, when films can do it right, is when there's no ""villain."""
"There are flawed people through the movie so writer Nancy Meyers is able to create dilemma, but nobody is a ""bad guy."""
Her films are like this and she's mostly successful.
Any movie like this is going to have a problem if the run-time is over 2-hours (The Intern is 2:01).
There's just no need for it.
"Also, the awkward way the The Intern had Jules (Hathaway) deal with Ben (DeNiro) was a snag in the movie."
The errors in the story are ones I wouldn't expect from a writer/director of Nancy Meyers' calibre.
"Once this clumsy part to the story is past, The Intern really takes off."
"With an 80% audience score, which is excellent, I'd say The Intern is definitely worth a rent."
This is a great movie.
It shows the stress of work and family while remaining positive.
Very enjoyable film.
Far exceeded my expectations.
"Sad in places, but funny and feel good mostly"
Loved the movie.
Loved the actors.
A nice feel good movie where you don't have to think that hard... just lose yourself in the idea of human relativity.
Lovely enjoyable feel good film.
"I gave it 5 stars because never once did the thought ""okay, when will it end"" come to mind as it usually does if the film drags... Also it had a nice story to it, if there were cliches I did not notice, because the film had my full attention."
"Decent actors, funny, heart warming, and it sends a good message."
I will be watching it again when it comes out on dvd for sure.
"The Intern is directed and written by Nancy Meyers, and it stars Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway in a comedy film about Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) who's a senior and wants to apply for a job."
"So when he come across a program that seniors would become interns from a fashion company, he wants to apply for it, got the job, and now work as an intern for the CEO of About the Fit."
"It has been a while since I've watched a Nancy Meyers film, and when I saw this film on HBO, I thought, why not, and just record it so I can watch it later."
"What I didn't realize is that I didn't expect this movie to be really great, just thought it was just there."
"Robert De Niro is terrific in this, probably his best in a long time as I haven't seen this type of character that he plays before, and he does it pretty well."
"Anne Hathaway does a good job of the character that she plays, and the chemistry between them is actually the best part of the film as they are pretty much having a friendship with no hints of of a romance, which I'm glad they didn't do that."
The writing by Nancy Meyers is pretty interesting in a way that I'm invested in the characters who are developed enough for me to find them likable and memorable.
"There were some parts that I was worried that it was going to be a big deal, but it goes by short and sweet, which I was relieved and I liked how it was handled."
"It's really funny, and the drama moments work really well."
"There were some plot elements that really did not need to be there, even if it is hilarious, and there were some predictable moments in there."
"But with all of that said, I clearly underestimate The Intern, and I'm glad that I did."
One of my favorite Robert Deniro movies.
"Old interns...hmmm haven't heard of this, but I guess it's happening."
This is the premise for The Intern and it's not a horrible one.
In fact the first half of this movie has a few decent laughs in it.
"However, the movie takes a turn from hey this old guy is working in a workplace that he's not used to, to old guy and young business owner having a relationship that you aren't sure where it's going."
"Movies that you know what is going to happen, and what is going to be said but take forever in saying that can be frustrating and that's a little of what is happening here."
"De Niro is solid here, Hathaway isn't horrible, her husband in the movie is way out of place."
He might as well walk around with a sign that says I'm a douche bag.
Save this one for the cheap theater.
It's not a good movie... and yet I had to give it a positive ranking because the characterization and conclusions the film makes are inherently different than films of this type.
It had me thinking about the conversations and themes and what exactly the film was saying.... and that's better than most films of this genre.
"This movie is so charming and heartwarming, Robert De Niro delivers his best work since Silver Lining Play Book and Anne Hathaway also does very well and alongside a decent cast and a very simple but good plot they are all delivering the goods in a very good movie, It's really recomended, especially if you want to feel good...:)"
touching and entertaining
Absolutely adorable!
"A cute film that is well acted my the 2 stars but is a little long, but is worth seeing on a first date."
Robert De Niro in another great role.
And oldie showing the inexperienced and young how to do stuff 'old school'.
"Clever, witty and well written dialogue."
Thoroughly enjoyable fish out of water movie.
Fun movie.
"No raunch, gore or ongoing foul language."
It was nice to feel respected by a movie.
A pleasant movie to watch.
Happy ending is a bit out of the norm.
One of the best feel good movies of 2015.
"It's enjoyable, Charming, well written and funny at certains scenes."
Robert Deniro is great as a charming intern wanting more thrills in his life and anne hathaway is great as Jules Ostin.
If you are looking for the next feel good movie.
This is one to watch and not miss.
"DeNiro was great, as usual."
Ending was too mushy.
"Just a nice, fun movie."
No one is getting any Oscar nominations out of it - but well acted by a good cast.
"I never get tired of seeing De Niro in a ""nice guy"" role."
A cute movie for a relaxing afternoon at the movies.
That's all.
And... it's enough.
Very nice movie!
"Hilarious, sweet, and encouraging!"
great soundtrack.
good story.
deniro was great
"A charming comedy/drama, Hathaway and DeNiro's relationship drives this lighthearted but touching film."
I was especially impressed with the depth and believability of DeNiro's character.
"The films deftly plays with inter-generational differences in work and family relationships, while showing how each generation benefits each other."
This was an overall feel-good film worth the light and easy journey.
It was an enjoyable movie cute funny all around good comedy movie to go see for sure
It wasn't bad...it was just not great.
"It still works so yeah, it didn't suck, go see it."
Went cinema to watch this.
great film for couples.
just a nice warm film .
"Surprisingly strong script, dynamic ensemble work between actors, and just a great feel-good trip to the cinema."
Because of De Nero there was a good turnout of The Old Geezers Who Go To The Matinee Alone and we were not disappointed.
A very charming movie about a 70yr old retired guy who takes an internship at a new online business.
Ann Hathaway (why is everyone always picking on her?
I think she's great) is the young lady trying to mix career and motherhood and being a wife.
No big action scenes just fine acting by everyone and a really charming story.
"Go if you get a chance, it's a feel good movie."
Robert De Niro turns up for a change and it's not quite as bad as the reviews suggest.
As Nancy Meyers films go it's not as bad as The Holiday but not as good as Something's Gotta Give.
Nice break from action movies!
Excellent story that really hits home for those of us that are getting on in years.
"Believable, well acted and memorable!"
"I felt this movie backed it self into a bit of a corner plot wise, and it ended a bit abruptly for me."
"However, I throughly enjoyed watching it- it had the whole theater laughing, crying, and laughing some more."
I never knew where it was going and all together it was a fantastic feel good film.
I thought it was a good movie
"You have a very good feeling about the main characters, especially Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro)."
But the story has no twist or anything good.
a little too long (over 2 hours ) and slow in spots.
de Nero great as usual.
wait for the rental.
It was a beautiful movie.
DeNiro was great and it showed.
Hathaway was delightful .
She was able to hold her own against DeNiro.
"Only complaint was, the movie ended leaving me wanting more."
Not a sequel but 10 more minutes would be nice.
It was very funny and bits of pieces were touching ... Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway at their best
Sweet and endearing movie about getting on life and complicated relationships in a modern world
Cute flick.
Love the unlikely friendship.
Was touching
This film has so much heart.
Absolutely loved the acting.
Well done!
"Pasante de Moda es una pel√≠cula muy Feminista (Hab√≠a que decirlo) que antepone un drama muy forzado que no funciona como cl√≠max, las situaciones comicas est√°n fuera de lugar siempre, y en t√©rminos generales es intrascendente."
"Lo rescatable es quiz√° el primer tercio de la pel√≠cula, en donde se ve un inicio bien definido donde se construye una linda historia de amistad que se desv√≠a de su camino para ser √∫nicamente salvada por las actuaciones de Robert De Niro y Anne Hathaway."
Really funny throughout.
Deniro and Hathaway were perfect in the roles.
This movie made me happy
I like Ann Hathaway.
I love Robert De Niro.
But I hate this movie!
The only thing making this movie even remotely entertaining is Robert De Nero however even he can't elevate this stereotypical story.
Lovely movie!
Great work by Hathaway and De Niro
Good for a few wholesome laughs and meaningful feels.
Saw the Movie Twice and it was Better each time!
What a wonderful credit to the Elderly person who has much more Music to play in their life!
I was thoroughly entertained and laughed a lot.
It was a lovely feel good story with some funny parts.
Happily see it again
Feel good movie that delivers exactly what would you expect from the circumstances.
Some goofy laughs thrown in as well.
Especially the break and enter.
"Good acting, awful plot."
Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway work well together but the plot takes too long to get into the main heart of the plot and the problems with her husband seem like an after thought.
At the end I don't think we're any further forward than we were at the start.
Mildly funny in places but the random hard-on joke made me cringe.
Very sweet and exactly what you'd expect from Nancy Meyers.
"If you liked her previous movies, which I did, you'll like this."
Actually much better than I expected .
RD and AH make seemed to have a fantastic rapport.
I loved this movie... Robert DeNiro is so charming!
This movie made me cry and the ending was just atrocious.
I don't know why it was listed as a comedy.
While it had its moments the entire thing was about sad subjects.
The ending was open ended and left cliff hangers.
It also gives off the impression if your husband cheats just forgive him and move on.
Terrible would not ever suggest.
I LoVeD this movie it was so good!
loved this movie!
robert de niro and anne hathaway were great in this movie as well as the upcoming and newcomers.
one of the sweetest story lines I have seen in a long time!
excellent movie.
laughed cried and enjoyed the connection between Hathaway and DeNiro
"Middling to fair, with solid, amicable performances but, when you stop to think about it, a thoroughly unnecessary film."
DeNiro is the only bright star in this thing.
The plot is predictable.
A slap-stick break-in scene in the middle is entirely out of place and does not contribute to the movie.
"And the ending is sudden, bland and more befitting an after school special."
Delightful!!
Had everything you would want.
"Comedy, realism, tenderness, infidelity, young love, family, work, child rearing and friendship."
The cast did an awesome job of making you believe what they were doing was real.
Will rent it to watch again soon.
Clean.
Relevant.
A definite must see.
It's just good things all the time.
"Magical old man, the movie."
Cute concept and observation.
Ending wtf?
The best movie of the year.
Great story line.
As light and insubstantial as candy floss.
The lead actors hold it together though.
Great feel-good movie
Heartfelt comedy.
Ends kind of abruptly.
"Not to confuse with 2013 Fox's The Internship, this similar type of drama without a ship behind feels more promising, funny but not ridiculous and thoughtful which one could have expected through its poster."
"The story delivers something fresh, a creative idea of senior citizen internship program to present the cross-generation relationship, events that are commonly occur in daily working life and how important is the experience of the elderly to inspire the younger generation."
"The film moves in a smooth pace, filled with nice musics and inspiring scores, along with a gentle spirit that attracts audiences to spend time following the amusing characters for about 120 minutes but a little bit upset by the rushing second half and too unrealistic perfection on its ending."
"However, the warm, charming and charismatic chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway is the sweetest and most beautiful part of the film to enjoy which makes us believe that we can manage well both career and family life."
We greatly enjoyed this movie.
"The chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway was excellent, and it was a pleasure to see a movie that developed a great plot without violence!"
Many minor characters were also well developed.
Interesting premise that developed well throughout the movie.
Highly recommend!
Nice!!
Light hearted!
Enjoyed the movie!!
:))
Not the greatest movie but still enjoyable.
De Niro and Hathaway were so believable and adorable in their respective roles.
I definitely recommend this movie when you need a mood lifter and/or encouragement.
I hope I'm that put-together at 70!
"Sorprendentemente entretenida, y lo mejor es que Robert De Niro vuelve a actuar, lease, no esta en automatico con en los ultimos 15 anos (salvo dos o tres excepciones)."
"Anne Hathaway tiene ""su momento Julia Roberts"" y lo sostiene durante toda la pelicula."
Vale la pena.
(Texto intencionalmente sin acentos).
DeNiro and Hathaway are a perfect complement to each other in this delightful funny movie.
Didn't want it to end.
Sllllloooowwwwwww.
"A few good laughs, but poor timing/pacing despite cast of award-winners."
Too looonnnnnnnggggg!
"Funny, light-hearted comedy with good acting."
Robert DeNiro shines as Mary Poppins ...
"A little longer than required but a nice enough, inoffensive film :)"
Lovely and sensitive.
Likely poor rating from less sensitive types.
"Thoroughly enjoyable and captivating story mainly due to the chemistry of Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro and the rest of the great cast, though Mary and I rewrote the ending after the film as it failed to deliver in our opinion."
A nice easy-to-watch movie with good performances by Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway.
Keeps you engaged.
I wanted to see something light hearted and fun and this was it :)
"Good cast but a bit slow in places, a good but predictable storyline."
If only this had a few more laughs in it & was a little shorter...
"While a perfectly alright watch, this film is nothing special."
"It recycles familiar stereotypes and cliches that you'd expect from a movie of this genre, meaning the little personality the film has all comes from its admittedly damn solid cast."
"That and while I admire what was attempted with certain plot points and themes, the film's ending doesn't tie up all the loose ends nearly as neatly as it seems to think it does."
"6,5/10"
Excellent picturisation of a retired man filling the gaps in his life.
Amazing just goes to show how even though old with experience.
Can truly show younger people how to do it.
Even though disrespect to the older people still is rife.
Really funny and well acted movie!
Sometimes you just have to pay the bills movies are some of my favorites.
"I love it when great actors make silly movies about love, family and dates strictly for the paycheck."
"Because they are good actors, the films are typically better than average, they are professionally made and for better or worse hit the spot without making you think or making you more stupid."
The Intern is a movie about stereotypes.
"Old people, young people, startups, New York, business etc etc etc...You can find every single cliche in this 2 hours comedy."
"I don't know if anyone should skip work to watch this movie, if you have a date or want to have a good time, just go."
It's not embarrassing.
Suprisingly excellent and hearfelt.
"The seamlessly ingenius filmaking that makes you feel like a first person experiencing what the two lead actors/actress are experiencing, is sheer genius!"
Fantastic film!
A shallow touch of the cliche generation gap subject.
The freshess of the movie mainly comes from Robert De Niro.
"Cause I haven't seen him not being grumpy, unfriendly and mean on screen for quite a long time."
And I keep thinking that his role would go to Robin Williams if he is still alive.
"Also, Anne Hathaway looks so ""Julia Roberts""."
A nice feel good movie.
This is a charming movie with some tender moments and some witty humour at times.
The story affirms and celebrates values of decency and good manners along with the contribution that older people can make to society.
Anne Hathaway has real screen presence as the young CEO who has to overcome her prejudices of having an older intern.
It's also good that Robert de Niro is back on screen in a decent role.
"While the direction loses its focus occasionally, this is an enjoyable, easy-to-watch comedy with some gentle critique of aspects of modern society and good chemistry between its lead actors."
A nice feel good film.
I love how this movie made the classy old school way of doing things cool again.
"""The Intern"" is a sure-fire hit for adults of all ages."
"Offering plenty of laughs and smiles, the film tosses in several heavy doses of reality and sadness-all mixed into an otherwise straight-forward storyline."
De Niro brings the calmness and demeanor of a James Bond around an office water cooler.
"His charisma and gentle manners takes us back to a slower, more enjoyable life and pace that can still work in today's nonstop world."
The always delightful Hathaway captivates us with her wide-range of acting tools.
"Together, the team of Hathaway and De Niro combine to give audiences an extremely enjoyable and warm big-screen experience."
Grade: A Read my entire movie review at www.reelbrief.com
"Decent, harmless, riskless, and therefore forgettable."
"There's nothing really bad about it, I guess."
But it just doesn't have enough there for me to remember.
"laughed, cried, worried, cleaver, loved it."
"Just entertainment, no big messages other than respecting your elders can be a good thing and mutual communication and respect between Millenials and boomers should be valued."
"Funny, heart warming and thought provoking."
Well worth the cost of the ticket.
I took a date and we both loved it.
Thought it would have been more of a comedy but it turned into a comedy with a love story and a little bit of a tear jerker at the end.
We would both watch it again.
Feel good movie you can't help but smile.
"No surprise plot twists or suspense, but an enjoyable movie about an older man able to befriend and mentor the young people in the company."
De Niro is ace while Anne is not far behind in this positive story of women power n balancing relationships.
The edit could have been crisper n sprinkled with more laughs in the script but overall the film does entertain.
"Rating: Fine I know sometimes the word fine has a negative connotation, but this is definitely the real definition: ""choice, excellent, or admirable""."
I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end with only some slight missteps along the way.
The strongest aspect of this film is the reality of it.
Throughout the story I felt that this characters will part of the real world.
And when you believe that the premise behind the movie becomes the clear focus and provides great insight to society while telling an engaging story.
The difference between the older generation of Robert De Niro and the younger workforce led by Anne Hatheway introduces just enough to make you question the modern day.
"While mentioning the actors we can applaud them because they did a wonderful job of getting us to care about the characters, it is nice to see De Niro throwing himself into a role, even if the character is mostly laid-back yet still charming."
"And of course Anne Hatheway remains to be one of the best actresses out there, and stunningly gorgeous."
The movie is not without faults when it attempts to juggle a few too many story-lines and characters that do not always follow through to a satisfying conclusion.
In the same vein some of those pieces mismatch the genuine lived in feel and just stand out as silly moments.
Still this is an enjoyable tale and y'all should definitely check it out if the premise looks intriguing to you.
Myers tells good stories especially about baby boomers and this is one of her better films due to the unexpected chemistry between Deniro and Hathaway!
DeNiro is very touching and believable as a man past his prime trying to prove he still has worth and Hathaway is very believable as a Career Driven working mom who wants it all.
Russo is also quite good as DeNiro's potential love interest.
Myers does include one plot mechanism that threatens to derail the movie but she recovers.
A good date movie!

Enjoyable funny movie with a bit of preaching monologue at time.
The ending is a bit too fairy tale.
"However, there's a potential for a part 2 movie or a tv series."
Thought it was a feel good movie....... a nice respite from all the violence around us all.
"Last night we went out with some friends to see, ""The Intern""."
"I know the reviews were mixed on this one, but this was the movie we all agreed on and I'm glad we did."
*** Robert De Niro was perfect for this part.
I advise that you see it!
"Tell me if you see a little,""Taxi Driver"" in it see if you can pick it out."
"Fun and very well written, a Nancy Meyers film, it's her best."
Dr Nero owned it!
A wonderful story with great acting that is plausible and demonstrates the differences between the generations and what each has to offer the other.
I surprisingly kinda liked it.
Is it going to be the best film of all time?
No.
Is it a fun time?
The chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway is top notch.
And that's what really sells the movie in my opinion.
"Really, I had fun and that's all that really matters for a film like this."
This was a very enjoyable movie.
It was very well-cast with parts that were touching and others that were funny.
Loved Robert DeNiro's character as well as Anne Hathaway's.
The trio who helped with the 'heist' was a hoot!
The plot line was not predictable.
SEE IT!
I have watched this movie more than once!
Wonderfully refreshing movie!
I fell in love with De Niro's character.
"Beautiful cinematography, perfect pace, and a great message."
My favorite kind of movie.
I wish they would make more like this!
Really sweet movie - made me smile a lot x
Another new little gem from director Nancy Meyers who has successfully made a modern buddy film with the most unlikely of characters.
The story of 70 year old Ben Whitaker taking an opportunity as an intern to a clothing web company helmed by Anne Hathaway.
Filled with great moments & characters & filled with a lot of truth.
Filled with some delightful moments & was so nice to see De Niro play the lovable character.
It's a charming film that isn't hard to fall in love with quickly.
In a sea of black films these days it's a rare treat to get a good old fashioned nice film.
Great moral values!
Rarely does Hollywood actually makes movies like this anymore without sex scenes and vulgarity.
This movie confirmed my opinion that critics see too many movies for different reasons than the rest of us.
People like it a lot more than critics do.
"It is funny, heart-warming and reminds me of several places I worked where I was the only mature person in the building."
I spend $x for 90 minutes of entertainment.
I'm okay with that - it seems like a fair deal.
Robert DeNiro is a charming old world gentleman and Ann Hathaway is the tech exec totally unprepared for her own success.
The chemistry works.
Cute date night movie.
"Ending kinda felt a little lame to me with her super fast forgiveness, but overall an entertaining movie."
It's really not much of a movie.
It's fluff.
Major fluff.
"But the legend himself, Robert De Niro, all geared up to play for humor and heart, is at his most charming and beguiling."
"De Niro is Ben Whittaker, 70, a retired widower hired as an intern for a Brooklyn e-commerce fashion house run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), a work-obsessed wife and mother who can't even think of what she could learn from an old guy until, well, she does."
"Writer-director Nancy Meyers (Something's Gotta Give, It's Complicated) and De Niro make it all go down way easy."
"This is an easy movie to like - what's not to, with DeNiro (self deprecating humor) and Hathaway (strong yet vulnerable) as the leads."
Charming but not overly impressive in terms of dramatic range.
!...great feel good movie...Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway are great together...excellent :)
"""Smooth & Cheerful ""."
"Fabulous, perfectly cast, funny, touching film about a 70 year old intern (DeNiro) at a fast rising ecommerce company and the frazzled young ceo (Anne Hathaway) who he befriends and mentors."
Very poignant.
I liked this movie a lot!
A movie so devoid of conflict (an email must be deleted!
a cashmere sweater arrives askew!)
"does not have the right to be so darn charming but somehow DeNiiro, Hathaway and company pull off an often sweet and wise workplace comedy."
"Besides the wonderful supporting cast, the ultra-crisp set design and cinematography make this Brooklyn warehouse a place anyone would want to work for free."
"My friend and I went to watch it just a few hours ago and we enjoyed the movie, it was funny, sad and more."
I would watch it again
"The Intern: A Perfectly Heartwarming film, and much much more!"
"The Intern' is run-of-the-mill heartwarming drama about a woman who makes good with an idea, a laptop, and a chair."
"It's the American Dream, you know.?"
"?Through a set of convoluted occurrences, the boss of an internet shopping company, thirty something Jules, takes on ""senior interns"" (people over 65) to work in her company."
That leads to a series of 'surprises.'
One surprise is that the old intern 'Ben' (De Niro) is not incompetent.
Shocking!
They learn that old people have something to contribute.
How heartwarming!
And the audience is shocked to learn that young folks don't have all the answers.
"Ben is so willing to help, you wonder where he has been all your life."
All the heartwarming drama nearly gave me a heart attack.
"Suffice to say, it's predictable."
The film's efforts to tell a unique story fall flat.
It is apparent that this is a star vehicle with a goal of making bank on the combination of De Niro and Hathaway on the screen.
"It doesn't bomb because of the expertise of the two stars, but the plot drags it down."
"Ben, a goodhearted seventy-year-old retired divorcee, teaches the youngsters in the office new tricks."
He effortlessly makes friends of everyone in Jules' office and knows exactly what everyone needs.
He is the perfect intern.
"At one point of the movie, Jules (Hathaway) asks Ben (De Niro), ""Why do you always say the perfect thing?"""
"Why, indeed."
"He's too perfect and he brings no conflict to the table; in fact, he's boring."
"Sure, his homespun logic and chill advice are clever, and it is too obvious."
But it is heartwarming.
"The overworked self-made women (Jules) doesn't have time for anyone, especially herself, as she tries to keep her company running."
"But she's a loving and patient woman who adores her daughter, Paige."
Her husband is the 'stay at home dad of the year.'
"Even when things go awry in their marriage, it's so damn heartwarming that it makes angels vomit."
"Age barriers are overcome through clever, pat answers."
A whiter-than-white cast stand insulated in a web of banal first-world problems.
The major conflict in the film comes down to control and self actualization.
"Sure, in the context of Jules' life, it's important."
"For a movie, it's not terribly compelling."
I'm surprised the film turned out as entertaining as it did.
"It helps that they didn't throw in a last minute cancer, house burning down or earthquake."
That is the rankest type of plot device and I am happy that I haven't seen that in recent dramas and romances.
"In the film, it's all upper middle-class white America all the time, as if we were in the 50s, Leave it to Beaver version of Brooklyn, NY."
I haven't seen a film this white since 'Boyhood.'
"Then again, an online vendor that sells clothing to ""housewives"" might attract mainly white college educated employees."
"Moreover, the film has to ignore class conflict in the 21st century in order to make Jules' problems at all dramatic."
"In the context of the world, her issues are trite and she is a pathetic whiner, type A personality who thinks her life amounts to a hill of beans in this crazy world."
"?Overall, it's handled by the actors: Rental For all the blandness, the two stars pull of a decently entertaining film."
But there is no reason to see it in the theater.
"Peace, Tex Shelters"
Very refreshing film.
"Very good story , not your typical cookie cutter comedy."
This was really enjoyable.
"Well worth seeing for some laughs , a good hearted fun movie."
Despite Deniro's best efforts this movie is a bore fest .
"Story line could have developed into the old man intern turns out to save the company , instead goes into a sappy ""my husband is cheating on me"" of characters no one actually cares about."
"The laughs were far and few in between,."
Great movie!!
"Proves people can be useful and beneficial, no matter what age!!"
"Robert DeNiro, as usual, is excellent..."
Good movie and entertaining One of the better chick flicks lately.
Robert De Niro is great
Sweet diversion.
"And, I learned that people are still useful after 70."
"Brutal... Not funny at all, unfortunately... Hathaway and De Niro are usually great but the plot and lines were just awful."
de Niro plays comedy really well in he latter part of his career (this and the Fockers franchise) some very funny laughs in this film as well as some really down to earth morals.
"Altogether a film that really works, it'll never be a Shawshank or a Ben Hur, but will stand on its own as a movie for the time and place it's set, when ecommerce and online shopping are either done via some other medium or has disappeared altogether."
"Anne Hathaway smoulders all the way through this and if she isn't the Audrey Hepburn for the 2000's, then nobody will be."
"Very fun story, great characters."
A light-hearted movie filled with smiles and laughs.
"Hathaway is her lovable and charming self, and good cast of supporting characters."
"Academy award winner, not."
Worthy of a rental.
Good performances by DeNiro and Hathaway.
I thought the story could have gone in another direction and been more satisfying to DeNiro's character.
I have to give 'The Intern' an A-.
I wasn't even going to see this film but then I got invited and decided to go.
I was pleasantly surprised.
I actually really enjoyed this movie.
It reminded me of a much better version of 'Devil Wears Prada' in a way.
I thought this movie had the right balance of funny and sad moments.
Acting is good of course especially with those great actors.
The movie was fairly long... about two hours but it was never boring.
It was just a very cute and feel good movie.
I would recommend it and see it again!
Sweet as breakfast cereal.
A good date movie.
"Of course from Director, Nancy Meyers as she did the best."
One of the best movies I like from her is Disney's The Parent Trap.
I do like the Intern a lot because it brings another perspective on how a successful retired businessman ended up in trying new things as signing up for intern at a fashion website business.
The movie is fun to watch and I do recommend it.
If you want some pleasant movie and just some laugh this movie is it.
Anne Hathaway is great and gorgeous in this movie.Robert De Niro did an awesome job in this one as well.
I'll give this movie a 4 out 5.
A chilled out movie and a good laugh.
A fine story too..Good to see some fine actors at work.
Overall enjoyable and perfect for a night in at home rather than at the cinema
Was a fantastic movie.
Funny at times.
Sad at times.
Wonderful the whole time.
Good plot line and quality acting
"Cute, funny, good message."
De niro is great in this role.
A feel good movie that will make you smile.
"good movie , great casting."
Big Nancy Meyers fan?
"I am but out of all the projects I've seen of hers, this is the weakest one."
"Though not a bad film, had a lot of flaws particularly the writing, though it is filled with a lot of laugh out loud moments, and good emotional, intense moments."
The main reason to see the film is the brilliant believable performance of Robert De Niro.
He charms the screen in his role as a senior intern working for the younger generation star Anne Hathaway.
"Like De Niro, Anne Hathaway is also very loving, funny, believable, and is someone you can't take your eyes off."
The two of them give it their all and have marvelous work/friendship chemistry together.
"The supporting cast is good for the most part but very underused, particularly Renee Russo."
"There are so many better ways the story could've gone, but this is not a very strong story."
"Overall though, very entertaining with much praise to the two leads."
My grade=81%(B-).
One of the most funny movies I've seen in a long time and not a cuss word spoken.
I liked it...old people and young people both have a lot to offer...let's get together.
We have a planet to save!
"Hilarious, uplifting, a GREAT MOVIE!"
This is a great feel good movie.
"I can't remember the last time I walked out of a theater with a feeling of hope regarding what can be very mundane ""every day life""."
What was even more fun is that it wasn't just me who reacted that way.
The whole theater was buzzing with optimism.
Have watched it over and over.
Loved the respect of experience which many millennials don't have.
HE'S DELIGHTFUL!!!
BOBBY HAS NEVER BEEN SO... CHARMING.
Best boomer date movie ever!
Delivers just what you would expect from a lite but touching relationship/comedy movie.
My wife and I loved it.
"Excellent cast, great chemistry."
Enjoyed The Intern.
Highlights how work environments have changed.
Enjoyed!
It's very good for what it is: a light-hearted feel-good movie.
"Some of the acting was lacking in many respects, but that's okay with this kind of film."
It's entertainment at its coziest.
This was a good night in film.
Laugh out loud moments.
"Good lead mix, love both actors"
Surprisingly Pleasant
"It was a well written, feel good movie."
"However- it was a little too corny at times, sometimes I believe that De Niro should drop all these 'old guy' roles and just accept all the accomplishments he has achieved before hand."
Muy buena!
I don't want to be buried alone
Great movie .
Didn't want it to end .
"A unique variation on the typical ""chick flick"" arc."
This movie is much more than it appears to me.
"It will make you feel, deep down."
It will surprise you.
My husband and I loved it.
"Cute, heartwarming, and funny."
Two great actors.
Real life!
Great movie and story.
Can't wait to buy the blu Ray!
"It was cute, but that's about it."
A bit corny on some spots but good and entertaining for family going.
What a breath of fresh air!
"So funny, very entertaining, my favs Ann & Robert, great cast!"
Exactly what you expect from a Myers film its sweet sugary familiar and has a neat story.
Hathaway owns an internet company and hires a retired intern in the guise of De Niro.
Kills 2 hours and is worth a watch
"Predictable, but good talented actors & acting."
Even more true subject since I work in human resources.
Many laugh out loud moments and it's nice to have a movie that makes you feel good about humanity again.
"I thought it needed about 5 more minutes at the end to wrap things up in a better and tighter bow, but all in all I recommend this movie highly and would definitely see it again!"
"Great movie, funny and serious at times."
"No surprises, easy story to figure out."
But the actors as good as they are keep you interested.
very funny and heartfelt.
"This movie was good, on the same premise of The Internship which I liked better."
"The Intern is evidence that movies can comedies can be uplifting, entertaining and sophisticated without crude humour and corny moments."
Strong leads from both De Niro and Hathaway together with other very solid and likeable characters meant that this was a very enjoyable movie.
The story is grown up and simple.
The laughs are gentle and subtle but it leaves you feeling happy.
Its a formula which has been tested before at silly humour level but this story is very realistic and bright.
A thoroughly excellent comedy which was totally unexpected.
It was lovely to see a film without a mean bone in its body.
The plot relentlessly refuses to go to obvious places and treats all of its leads and even minor characters with respect.
"The film suffers mildly from having no villain or major conflict, but makes up for it with the charming interplay between DeNiro and Hathaway, who have cut crisp corners on each of their character's back stories, giving us three dimensional people whom we legitimately care about and want to see them succeed."
Big fan of Anne and Robert.
Liked it!
"It was fun, charming, a bit unrealistic but still entertaining."
"It was sweet, its a nice change away from the sci-fi/action/superhero movies that dominates the box office."
"Smart, funny, charming and an overall feel good film."
VIEWS ON FILM review by Jesse Burleson 2015's The Intern (my latest review) is great.
There I said it.
"This is feel-good, cotton candy people."
You stagger out of the theater with a sense of giddiness.
"Then you say to yourself, ""wow, that's a real film""."
Its lead (Mr. Robert De Niro) has never been more likable.
"You wouldn't even know it's the same guy who played psychotics (Taxi Driver, Cape Fear), hardened criminals (Heat, The Family), and ornery grandpappys (Meet the Fockers, Little Fockers) some years ago."
Crazy.
"With his co- star being Anne Hathaway (also very likable), screen chemistry is indeed abounding."
A friendship develops between their characters producing an inner wallop.
"Now in all honesty, I don't ever cry at the movies."
"Here, I got the sniffles and that's saying something."
"As directed by Nancy Meyers, ""Intern"" has one of her trademarks written all over it."
That would be the adage of well-off people having problems (in relationships) that aren't life-threatening.
You could also include the notion of two protagonists sharing scenes and being worlds apart in age (remember Keanu Reeves and Diane Keaton in Something's Gotta Give?).
So yeah this flick is cutesy at times.
Yeah it ends with a level of uncertainty (talking about cinema makes way for interpretation you know).
Yeah it starts off sort of predictable.
"Yeah it has some nitwit, supporting characters and yes, there's a cringe-worthy boner gag (don't ask)."
"But look closer and stick around for the full two hours (despite what other critics thought, the overlength didn't bother me)."
There's something deeper than what was advertised in the trailer.
"Here's a hint and spoiler alert (warning): The husband of Hathaway's persona (Matt Ostin played by Anders Holm), isn't much of a shade and doesn't hold the screen until his revelatory stance hits you up in the third act."
"Talk about a plot diversion in a so-called, mawkish comedy."
"Shot near the perky side of Brooklyn, New York and featuring an email heist referencing caricatures from Ocean's Eleven, The Intern is a romcom without the ""rom"", a centerpiece sledgehammering facets of old age (you could also throw in older people's spar with newer technology)."
The story starts off without a struggle or conflict before later kicking into high gear.
"You have Ben Whittaker (De Niro), a widower who just wants some higher form of human interaction."
"He's retired, he's traveled the world, he hangs out at Starbucks, and when walking down the street, he gets hit on by weird women (Linda Lavin from the TV show Alice, who'd thunk it)."
"Sadly, this is not enough for him."
"The solution: He signs up for a community outreach program in which seniors intern for thirtysomething boss, Jules Ostin (Hathaway)."
"Ostin owns a Internet fashion company, built from the ground up."
"She's initially reserved, conservative, and off-putting."
And her first impression of Ben is that he's too observant not to mention a little invading.
Then things change.
"As time marches on, De Niro's Ben and Hathaway's Jules form a wonderful kinship."
They eventually turn into best friends.
"Refreshingly, it was great to see two Oscar winners thrive at the top of their game."
"When they're on screen (together or separate), ""Intern"" is a real winner."
"When they aren't in frame (which hardly ever happens), the material is sadly, a little sluggish and kind of hackneyed."
"Anyway, if you've recently watched The Internship (2013), you'll somewhat be reminded of The Intern."
Both films start off similar yet the latter ascends to something much greater.
"Bottom line: Chalk up another round of effective, sentimental goo courtesy of the veritable Nancy Meyers."
I'm gonna go with a rating of 3 and a half stars on this one.
Of note: De Niro's Ben Whitaker has a need to fill a void in his life.
He's retired with money yet is bored.
That's why he takes on the task of working in e-commerce territory.
"De Niro the actor, well he seems to be filling that same void (Bobby's rich but still likes to appear in three to four movies a year)."
"With endeavors like Grudge Match, Last Vegas, New Year's Eve, and 2013's Killing Season, he hasn't been too picky about his projects."
"The Intern thankfully, reverses this trend."
"Mucho ""De Niro"" justified!"
Sweet movie...
I was happy to see Rene in the movie too.
who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks?
"follow the life of a business man, and widower, as he struggles to find his place in life after retirement."
"i really enjoyed the love-hate, father/daughter type chemistry between Jules and Ben, as they try and better each other's lives one awkward situation at a time."
"some parts were cheesy, and some parts probably could have been added, or left out, but overall the movie comes together nicely."
"i recommend this movie if you need a heart warming, fun loving, comedy, or if you just love any of the actors, because they were all pretty good, even the unneeded fillers!"
Good date movie...great chemistry with Anne Hathaway and Robert DeNiro..
A nice clean feel good totally enjoyable movie...very refreshing for a change
Love d it!
Feel good movie of the year for me.
Light and thought provoking.
"If you know how to listen, then it's a decent movie."
It's by no means an award winner; you've been warned!
"Be a gentleman and take a hanky, as the lady of your life will need it and it will go well after the film."
"It was not super girly, or a straight up comedy."
It was a nice feel good movie.
bad ending ruins everything
"Despite having a knack to make charming romcoms, Meyers self-sabotages her premise."
The Intern is about fitting in with the times while maintaining a certain humbleness before those who have what is irreplaceable: life experience.
While the film is a glimpse into 90s Hollywood in modern cinema - and some of the good that came with it - it also shows that the cinematic language has evolved but Myers didn't.
"The Intern is one of the best rom com style movie that I've seen in awhile, even though there isn't much romance between our main characters other than a father daughter relationship."
De Niro is adorable in this movie and Hathaway is the essence of a working woman.
"This movie is simple but it's effective in everything it tries to do, and may even have an underlying message about how we see women is the work place and in society."
This was a cute movie a little predictable at times but a feel good movie.
entertaining.
not to girly
Fun and entertaining!
The Intern is a sweet comedy that benefits from it's simple plot and likable performances.
"another warm, funny Nancy Meyers movie."
Love De Niro!
Hubby and I both loved it.
Worth watching in movie theaters.
"I'm sure if you have not seen it, go see it."
You will like it.
This is not the typical movie in which I would elect to see normally.
"However, I did enjoy the movie."
"It is somewhat methodical, but the actors engage you to pull you into the movie."
If you'd like Robert De Niro you'll love him after seeing this movie.
There were funny moments throughout and the acting was good.
"I would have preferred more of a conclusion, but loved this movie!"
Best movie I've seen in a while!
Best comedy that i've seen in past 2 or 3 years
"very sweet movie, and very uplifting Robert Deniro's character."
It's like the Devils Wear Prada in a parallel universe.
great story a funny way of putting a lot of meaning into the story.
a must see.
great theme.
Delightful.
A real feel-good movie.
Loved this movie--funny and surprising.
A sweet and wise portrait of two unlikely friends.
Refreshing and worth your time!
Chick flick.
Inoffensive.
Predictable.
Can a movie be too nice?
"Even with some drama inserted, this Nancy Meyers comedy is too lighthearted and you just end up smiling the entire time, which is not a bad thing."
"DeNiro, who is usually seen as a grump is cute in this."
"I can't believe I eve used that word to describe him, but he is cute and charming."
Anne Hathaway is her usual pretty self.
I think her character was a little too nice and could have had an edge to her a la Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada.
"Like I said, the movie is all nice where everyone is nice and everything is wrapped up in a nice little bow in the end."
"Lucky for me, I like these kinds of films, but for those who don't, the sap may be too much."
Grade: B+
It was so nice to go and see a funny movie that my husband also enjoyed.
Go see it you wont be disappointed.
Just the sort of roll I lone to see Dinero take on.
However they could have chosen a much better female lead.
Someone who can act might have been novel!
A movie that is hard to dislike.
"Don't go into it expecting another Oscar worthy performance from DeNiro, but do go into it ready to smile, laugh, tear up, and have a good time."
Each actor gives a heart-felt performance.
They are all very convincing in the roles and show good humor for older and younger audiences.
"For a comedy movie, it wasn't as cheesy as most other comedies are, and it also shared some very realistic moments of sadness."
The perfect film for a Friday night.
"Feel good, happy movie, not too many movies you see Robert Dinero play the good guy and not say the words f**k once in."
Much better than my expectation.
"Hits all cords on age, work success and fidelity."
My husband & I loved this movie .
I will buy it when it comes out on Blue Ray.
Don't listen to the Rotten Tomatoes the critics have it.
They are hardly ever right.
Make up your own mind.
I really really really (do not know how many times I can say it) loved this movie.
"A feel good and happy story about friendship, love, and overall respect."
A movie that makes you feel happy and centered.
To bad there are not more movies like this.
A total must see.
The Intern is directed by Nancy Meyers and stars the great Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway.
This is the first Nancy Meyers film I am seeing and I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed the intern.
"The Intern is a sweet feel good comedy that starts off as a movie showcasing the differences in lifestyle,mannerisms and characteristics between the current generation and the older generation before heading towards the more drama heavy side of things with De Niro guiding Anne Hathaway in some of her life choices."
De Niro is fantastic in this film and his character is so likeable.
Anne Hathaway is great as well and the chemistry between the two is the main reason why this movie is so damn entertaining.
De Niro's interactions with some of the other younger interns are also hilarious and had the audience laughing out loud.
My only issue with the intern is that there are some unnecessary scenes which don't really add much to the movie and hamper the pace making it feel slightly long.
The Intern is definitely worth watching when you are in the mood for something light hearted.
"Hilarious, I laughed HARD multiple times."
Great mix of emotions felt in this movie.
Good movie for a date and or with a few buddies.
It was a perfectly okay movie but nothing spectacular.
Anne Hathaway was believable and vulnerable in her role but I wish that they would do more with Robert DeNiro.
DeNiro plays Ben and he's just Jules' lackey for most of the movie.
He has some great scenes but he's mostly there to make Jules feel better about herself.
I quite enjoyed this movie.
I really loved this movie.
It made me laugh.
It made me cry.
"It was different, but it still had a very realistic plot line."
"I don't know if it was a movie I'd watch over and over and over, but I definitely enjoyed it and would be willing to watch it again in the future."
DeNiro and Hathaway were wonderful together.
Even my husband like it!
"It's a bit too heavy on the sentimental side, and it has some problems with pacing."
But the two leads make up for it.
"Out of the long list of films I had planned to go and see, The Intern was nowhere close to being on that list, but when my girlfriend felt the need to tag along to the movies with me and adamantly suggested that we take a break from the norm and try one of ""her movies"", I went against my better judgment and begrudgingly agreed, little did I know she would choose a film that was finally watchable."
"I say watchable because this movie is basically a sequel to The Devil Wears Prada but without Meryl Streep, but instead plugging Robert De Niro in the Anne Hathaway role and allowing Hathaway to play the Miranda role without the attitude and confrontation, thus making this movie a boring heartwarming work place character piece without the drama."
This film comes across as just a movie to fill a slot during a slow weekend where no prominent films that people take seriously were debuting.
The pacing is slow and the characters are bland to the point that you don't care about whatever benign conflict that they try to interject into the plot to give the story purpose and I was just hoping that the movie would hurry up and reach its obvious conclusion so I could leave.
The casting was about the only thing that they got right with this movie.
The plot was basically a mash up of The Internship and The Devil Wears Prada but without the witty one liners or eccentric bosses which leaves you wondering what's the point.
"At best this is about on par with a made for tv Lifetime movie which pretty much means I am not in the demographic that this movie was trying to target, but if your into that very mellow drama kind of films then I would say it is better than most and worth you checking out"
"A Nancy Meyers film has no place for gritty realism so with that in mind, this is a safe and nice film that's slightly overlong, oftentimes sitcom-y and does exactly what it says on the tin."
"Lack of surprises aside, De Niro and Hathaway gave it their best to give the flimsy material some weight and drama in the third act but it was never meant to be."
The takeaway here is that the technology obsessed youths can learn a few things from seniors who've got the experience of life.
How delightful but hardly profound!
The script could've been written by your hip grandma who has managed to master whatsapp - give it an extra star rating if you are into that sort of escapist nonsense.
"This was a delightful, warm,funny, feel-good movie."
De Niro and Hathaway were naturals.
Clothes were beautiful.
Story of tech start up was a great canvas.
"Delightful - no drugs, no dead bodies, no monsters."
Yeah!!
this was a nice movie with a nice story and good acting by the leads.
"It had some funny parts but also had jokes fell flat or were corny, possibly just not my type of comedy, But it did make me laugh and I enjoyed it somewhat."
"It also had some extensive sappy girly parts, which I didn't mind at first but then it started getting old."
I would probably recommend this to my mom (1 viewing)
Original in the way you see life from the retired side.
"Great starring actors, which make this very simple story enjoyable and entertaining."
I guess if I could be and have half as much as Deniro character I'll be very happy - except the widower part!
"Not a lot of action and no complicated story twists, but a nice, simple, heartwarming story."
"Most astonishingly, DeNiro and Hathaway have real chemistry."
"The plot is thin, but the movie is charming."
very funny.
great story.
Absolutely Loved this Movie!!!
You will be missing out if you don't see it!
;)
Recommended for all
good stuff right there
This movie proves that you don't need things blowing up all the time or people hopping in and out of bed to make a likeable movie.
Is it some big emotional trauma movie?
No it's just a slice of life--- and it was done well.
Love the idea of senior help in a modern age.
You can always learn from the past.
Take guidance and learn.
Enjoyed the movie and the message.
Good movie with your spouse or significant other.
Good movie for you and older.
A wonderful movie.
Great humor!
Casting was perfect.
With age comes experience and wisdom.
A lesson to be learned when watching this movie.
awesome movie.
"great humor, makes some really good statements, awesome cast."
one of my favorites recently.
I have only one idea why the critics panned it.
"It had traditional values like hard work, dedication, loyalty, family unity and Robert DeNiro plays a complete gentleman."
That seems reason enough for critics to hate it.
This is a great movie Ann Hathaway is great in this and it made a wonderful date night movie.
Feel good movie.
I think some of the bigger comedy moves detracted from the subtlety of DeNiros humor and that was too bad.
Nice story and good cast.
Lost a mark from me for just being a bit too long.
"It was fun, light hearted and refreshing."
I'll buy it on blu-ray to be that pick me up movie when I'm down
The Intern' sometimes has a weak plot development or bad line of dialogue but the actors make this work.
Robert DeNiro is under stated and charming and Anne Hathaway gets her best romantic role to date and comes off as sweet.
"This is very low key, entertaining, a little formula but director Nancy Myers can do this kind of movie in her sleep."
Cheesy and predictable ...not worth seeing in the theater.
"Cute, funny, predictable but a couple nice surprises."
Was GREAT for a date night.
"A film where you care about the characters, laugh out loud and finish the film with a smile on your face."
Chick flick√∞?
?¬¥ Bobbi D!
Has it come to this?
This movie has been promoted as a comedy but its really little more that a 'chick flick' designed to propagate the idea that 'you can have it all'.
"Jules has a successful startup company, a loving and supportive husband and a beautiful daughter but her commitment to her career results in problems at home."
"The company decided to develop a 'Senior Intern' who, over time, becomes like a father to her."
With the wisdom of Solomon he guides her through various problems.
In true Hollywood fashion this 70 year old middle-class guy just happens to have spent his career as VP of publishing company (don't all middle class people retire from upper level management?).
"When the problems at home begin to take its toll he, in true feminist fashion, convinces here that even though she has little time for her family its not her fault and that she needs to be ""true to herself""."
I guess that means she should put herself ahead of her family and others.
"Overall, a 'feel good' movie with good acting and a story line that does entertain."
Were it not for the obvious sexist theme and absurd message I might rate it higher but because of its heavy political nature I can only rate it 2 stars
"clean, refreshing, entertaining"
Really enjoyed DeNiro in this.
A lot.
I enjoyed it.
Being 62 helped.
De Niro's love life seemed not really to fit except to garner a few laughs.
All in all it was watchable but not a must see.
An enjoyable evening at the movie.
Yes it is a feel good movie and not challenging but what is wrong with good acting and fun entertainment.
The professional critics need to recognize that not every movie has to be a stretch.
LOVED IT!
Headed back to see it again today
Fabulous!
A must see!
I enjoyed this more than I thought I would.
It could have gone a little further but good solid chemistry and a good message made for a worthwhile experience.
Worst movie I've payed in 2015
"Very cute movie, even my kids loved it."
Robert Dinero was brilliant.
"A senior citizen takes an internship in an internet company, after losing his wife."
"To begin with his a joke, but as the film goes on he turns into the hero!"
A nice film worth watching
"""The Intern"" is a film starring Robert DeNiro who enters a senior citizen internship program to bring a new dynamic to Anne Hathaway's start-up telecommunications firm."
"At first, Hathaway has a hard time warming up to DeNiro but comes to form an affecting, unlikely bond with him."
"This film is watchable, but I wasn't sold on the whole new-age generation gap thing."
This film has a lot to say about generation gaps and that older people have to get hip with the current times.
"While both are highly competent actors, I thought the dynamic was a bit bizarre, and had their ages not been so vastly different, it might have worked."
Both do solid acting but it doesn't make the relationship any better.
"I thought the film was also fleeting and absent a decent score and some interesting dialogue, this film is thoroughly forgettable."
It is very whimsical and doesn't tread any new narrative ground not treaded before.
This is a film meant for simple viewing without any deeper meaning --------------------------------------------------------------- C+
Entertaining with good acting from its leads.
"There was a little too much going on with the supporting cast, most of it irrelevant and uninteresting."
Another hit for Nancy Meyers.
De Niro and Hathaway were very well matched.
The laughter in the theater said it all.
"Laughed throughout the whole movie, loved this flick!"
Very touching and heartfelt; DeNiro is either being directed in a Cromer style or mailling it in but it works; Hathaway is very likeable
"Slow to start, and largely predictable, but mostly avoids cliches."
A mildly interesting premise - what would happen if 70 year old Robert De Niro were working for internet startup entrepreneur Anne Hathaway?
"At first, very little but the film builds to a nice ending, but with a firm ambition to sell you The Intern 2 too."
"61 year old Rene Russo is the love interest for De Niro, The rest of the characaters are not really explored serving variously as foils for De Niro or Hathaway."
Some of the plot is implausible - how does De Niro solve an IT problem that the Internet startup boss cannot?
"Mostly seeing this film reminded me of the character De Niro played in ""Once Upon A Time In America"", The 70 year old De Niro looks very look the aged gangster Noodles Aaronson ."
But Nancy Meyers is no Sergio Leone.
"This is an altogether gentler film, sentimental in parts,"
I really enjoyed this film from start to finish.
"Surprisingly charming, but one note and sluggish."
"Two good performances from stars Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro make this pretty forgettable story into an okay, watchable movie."
"The writing is fairly weak and the characters are a bit exaggerated, but the production design is great."
"All in all, ""The Intern"" is a well acted, average movie that your grandmother will love."
overall it was pretty funny but they put too much real life issues in it for it to be considered a true comedy.
Very original and appeals to all ages!
Recommend to everyone.
Touching mix of various themes.
"The writing was formula, boarding on ageism."
"What I found most offensive was the young daughter who twice referred to her school mate as ""bi-polar""."
What is funny about that?
This is the year 2015 and Bi-polar is a mental illness.
Light and carefree.
Love Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway in this funny comedy.
Highly recommended to everyone.
great movie to watch if your a fan of De Niro or Hathaway.
I can honestly say though if your under the age of 30 this might not be your kind of movie unless its a date night movie.
good hearted comedy happy ending type of flick very rare these days.
if you read critic reviews most say its just ok my review: take your parents or your date sit down and enjoy a good clean comedy with a heart
I need a wife like Anne Hathaway so I can be stay at home dad
"Too entertaining to warrant a senior skip day thanks to its leads, The Intern takes a softball approach to its promising premise but moviegoers can't help but love the chemistry behind this office non-romance."
"Just like with any other Nancy Meyers comedy, moviegoers get introduced to a work roster of goofy but lovable supporting characters and an overall story that feels fresh despite ultimately plucking the strings of predictability."
"Oh, some unsuspected roadblocks might surprise you but the final trajectory's always pretty clear."
"What makes The Intern unique so far as this writer-director's CV goes, however, is the age of the female lead."
"Her ensemble work aside (The Holiday), Meyers tends to stay within her actual range (Diane Keaton, Something's Gotta Give and It's Complicated)."
"In dotcom founder Jules, however, we get a mega successful glass ceiling-breaking online store founder who's got a family to boot."
"Far from a caricature, she's also a spread-too-thin boss who invests in a camaraderie and loyalty-building environment for her employees (on-site masseuse, lax dress code, office bike riding), as well as no patience for her mother and not enough time for her hubby."
"In Anne Hathaway, Meyers finds one of the only actresses capable of coloring in and outside of her lines to a brilliant degree."
"You come to love Jules, just as you do the title character."
"Since committing to comedy nearly full time (Analyze This, Meet the Parents), Robert De Niro has gotten warmer and has gotten the audience to warm to him more as an Everyman."
Notice that those successful flicks listed in the last sentence don't require much suspension of disbelief for buying the actor outside of his usual tough guy wheelhouse.
"With The Intern, however, we get a full drawn portrait of a still-vital retiree helping Jules through some crucial work and life changes."
"Hathaway and De Niro work so well together and their personalities complement so perfectly at this juncture in their lives that you wonder how they would have melded if she got dropped into one of his films during the height of his H'wood run (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas)."
"In this PG-13-rated comedy from writer/director Nancy Meyers (The Parent Trap, What Women Want), a 70-year-old widower (DeNiro) becomes bored with retirement and takes a senior intern position at an online fashion site created and run by a much younger woman (Hathaway)."
"Beyond Hathaway and De Niro's compatibility, however, their remains some problems with this twosome's vehicle."
"Fluffy is the word for The Intern, which could have made some riper social commentary as to the actual viability of pension-aged Americans in the workplace and old vs. new approaches to business."
"Oh, Meyers bats around such discussion a bit but she seems to be wearing an oven mitt, only lightly touching on these talking points."
"Still, even the color-by-numbers moments make for an enjoyable office dynamic."
Bottom line: High Pension
"On a scale of 1 to 10, I gave this a 10."
"Even though there are well known actors, I really did forget they were actors and got lost in the characters."
The movie made me laugh and cry.
Really liked it!
"This movie has a great cast, good premise and just a good recipe for a great movie."
Sadly it wasn't what I expected at all.
The script was poorly written and the first half of the movie was up its own a$$ with happiness.
It was cheesy and boring.
"Within the first ten minutes, me and my girlfriend both looked at each other, both realizing we had made a huge mistake."
"Thankfully, about halfway through the film drops a huge bombshell that FINALLY causes some dramatic tension."
"Unfortunately, it was too late for me to get interested."
"I walked into this film with high hopes and walked out angered, angry because I didn't get to see the Robert de Niro I wanted to see."
Angry because I know Anne Hathaway is much better than she seemed in this film.
Angry because I lived in New York and I know that no one is that freaking happy.
Do not waste your money or your time.
1 star.
Refreshing movie.
"No violence, killing, or weapons."
It's such a feel good movie.
I'm going to see it again.
"Despite having some major flaws - undercutting its feminist message slightly at the end, random sexual jokes, odd character development for DeNiro's love interest - the chemistry between Hathaway and DeNiro is enough to make it enjoyable, and both are perfectly cast."
It's funny throughout and I ended up really caring about the characters.
Pretty entertaining.
I've watched the movie and it's heart warming and funny.
Great story I really enjoyed this movie
It was a cute movie.
"I didnt agree with one of the major decisions one of the character made in the film, but overall a good movie that puts the spotlight on seniors in our society today."
It will be a good movie to see with your parents or on a date.
The trailer for this film made it look like a clich√© ridden formulaic effort that would fall flat.
"However, having seen the movie, I found myself presently surprised."
"While it did tread down a few familiar paths, it avoided just as many clich√©'s as it succumbed to and had a few genuinely unexpected moments."
"It helps that the film maintains a light and breezy tone, moves quick from scene to scene and is filled with hilarious one liners."
Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro share brilliant chemistry and deliver fine performances!
"Among the most ""feel-good"" movies I've seen in recent times and you're sure to leave the cinema with a smile on your face!"
What is there to say about this film.. Nancy pulled a stereotypical Nancy.
"Between attractive & wealthy white people, beautiful sets, and a mid-movie problem that ends up working out, this movie is everything you expect and maybe even more."
"Not my cup of tea personally, but not a terrible date movie."
Funny & Feel Good Experience if you need a little lift............
I've seen few more pleasing movies than this one.
"For a very mainstream comedy, it is smart and superbly well-paced."
The performances are spot-on; De Niro has never been as likable.
Fine movie to take your wife to.
"I think Anne Hathway is destined to play a role like this one, just like her other (look alike) famous movie ""The Devil Wears Prada"", The Intern also showing her sophisticated fashion style (but maybe it's because she's working as the owner of online fashion site) so she need to be fashionable but yet stil look casual, the point is i love the style!"
esp that (i think) Givenchy blazer!
I want to have it!!
"I also love the office, it's gorgeous!, want to stroll around Brooklyn oneday!"
"The story is good, the dialogue is good too, the message is also good."
Robert De Niro still look handsome in his age!
(i envy man sometimes -.-).
It makes me want to have an (fashion) e-business like Anne too..hmmm Oh!
"And i lovee when she has a conversation with her mom, it's so me!"
"(but i hope not like me, i want to be a good daughter..hihihi) one of funny part from this movie."
"Tender, happy, - just great!"
Superb acting by all!
Very impressive
Outstanding movie with a little something for everyone.
DeNiro was perfect and Hathaway gives a stellar performance.
Much more than just a comedy.
And the actress that played the little daughter is just amazing.
Great storyline and just enough comedy and drama to make it almost perfect.
I enjoyed this movie.
It explored the relationship between two generations and made you realize that we can all learn something from others.
"Very nice romantic, and comedy, movie!!"
De Niro and Hathaway play very well together!!
Good in many pleasant way!
2015 with Babette - RWC 2015 Favorite
Such an inspiring movie
You critics have no soul.
You incompetent pieces of trash.
The two main characters were meant to be together to fill in the gaps.
Wonderful friendship film.
Big Deniro fan.
And loved this movie.
Really good hearted fun!
A very light and likable adult comedy.
Hathaway holds her own against a very expressive De Niro.
A bit of a surprise was the way Meyer decided to handle a cheating partner.
"I would have expected it to be handled on a more feminist way, but it wasn't."
"A couple of plot holes here and there, but overall a likable effort."
B-
A really enjoyable show to watch.
"Overly sentimental and turns into a huge mess by the end, but there is no denial that watching The Intern feels like a good time and a modernized rom com that actually works."
Awesome movie.
Love the generational differences in characters and humor.
Was absolutely great!
Entertaining and thoughtful.
The best acting with a terrific story.
GO SEE IT!
"The Intern is like a fresh air after a lot of overwhelming films that accentuate actions, and visual effects."
"One thing for sure, De Niro's act is the most eye catching on this film."
I loved every moment of this movie.
Please make a sequel
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
I'm not typically a Deniro fan but he was awesome.
Just a good clean story and movie.
Down right awful.
"This movies drags, is depressing, slow, etc."
"Waste of money, don't spend yours on it."
My boyfriend and I both agree.
We almost got up and left
Anne and Robert were magical together.
Storyline had good points and character development was strong.
So relatable and heartwarming.
"Great movie, not a single slow part in the movie."
"Nice, easy watch movie."
Loved Robert De Niro!
I want him to come work with me.
What a gentleman!
"Anne Hathaway is amazing and gorgeous, Rene Russo my ideal, really like that new comer Adam DeVine and Andrew Rannells."
A real feel good movie!
We went with a group of friends and all enjoyed the movie thoroughly.
It was a lot of laughs and just a feel good movie..
A feel good movie from opening credits to closing credits.
"The movie is fun, sad, has things to say that we all need to hear said."
"Jack, Ann & Rene are great."
I've just walked out of the theater.
You'll like the movie.
Haven't written a review in a long while but this little gem of a movie deserves it.
"I wanted to see this movie ever since I saw the preview...loved the premise of senior citizen interns working for a young company on top to Anne Hathaway & Robert DeNiro I had some high hopes, and it delivered."
Anne and Robert's chemistry was fantastic.
Awesome supporting cast as well... the theatre in stitches for a good part of the movie.
"The storyline was somewhat predictable, but it was exactly the kind of movie I needed...some escapism & laughter... a truly enjoyable couple hours watching a fun story play out."
Worth watching at the movie theatre or at home.
best show of the year.
Robert Deniro and Anne Hathaway hit it out of the park!
delightful.
glad we didn't pay attention to critics reviews.
we and all our friends enjoyed the film.
de niro - great.
"Extremely sappy, but also extremely entertaining and heartfelt."
"Problems arise when there isn't any real, tangible conflict throughout the entire run-time, but there's just enough substance here to be worthwhile, and quite a few laughs."
"You could do much, much worse."
"Though a bit generic and cliched, the Intern has good charm and good performances from it's cast."
"Great movie, pleasantly great mix of humor, good vibes, and just all around good time."
Brought a smile to my face.
This was an exceptionally funny movie right from the get go.
The humor was clean and old fashioned comedy ....there should be moreover like this made.
"A casually emotional journey through everyday, though affluent, lives."
"Explores both the waning and beginning of adult American life, and the benefit of inter-generational relationships."
Pleasantly touching.
Who casted Napoleon Dynamite as Ann Hathaways husband?
That was my only issue.
Rather enjoyed the movie even though it ran slightly long.
I did like how the story unfolded.
The characters clicked and De Niro & Hathaway had on screen chemistry I didn't expect.
Absolutely one of the best movies!
"It was heartwarming, funny and well played."
A great feel-good movie!!
DeNiro and Hathaway are great together.
Best film in a long time.
Wonderful perspective on the world today.
"So much potential, such a disappointment."
1st and 2nd act was great.
Then it's as if the comedy writers from those acts left and then came back after having their hearts removed and tried to suck all the joy out of you.
Acts 1-2 you cry from laughter.
The last 30 minutes you cry because the writers think you should suffer and there is no happiness left in the word and all the characters arcs should go to a state of depression for which Prozac can't fix.
"It was a very heart warming, feel good kind of movie and I left the theater with a big smile on my face."
It is working perfectly but one poor decision/subplot nearly derails it.
"Deniro is so sweet and charming, a great subdued performance from an alltime great"
A thoroughly entertaining movie.
They are great in the movie together.
Just a lovely movie.
"This was a great movie, the actors were great, the story was interesting, I liked the emotions, they felt real."
I think retirement is not what one expects and showing the blending of old school and IT was interesting.
Go see this movie.
I cannot tell you just how much I LOVED this movie!
Went tonight with my husband and will come back with my mom.
You will LOVE this movie!!
LOVE it - NOT A feel good but A FEEL GREAT & laugh OUT LOUD
I think it was very entertaining movie and I think people should see it it beats a lot of the action-packed overdone movies today
I got to think but all y'all critics that giving 57% bad rotten.
you all just don't have a life.
live a little have the good humor.
this movie brought good laughter and good humor.
"I was in one of the Auditorium that had over 80 people and everyone was laughing with good humor, especially with Robert Deniro."
One thing all you critics how about you watch it again but with humor not with a stupid dick face to give bad critics.
how about go watch it again but with out thinking about Golden Globe or any nomination.
"Jeff Boam, how about stop taking others critics opinion, and making it your own."
all that nonsense bullshit of how inspired you are about Myers.
and instead think of your own opinion.
"Now a day, yes some movies are a waste of spending money to make and can't even get it right."
Yes Hollywood has spent million on movies and made them pointless or a waste.
but some of this Writer or Director still have the classic thoughts about how to make the movie right.
"Some of these are not worth for nomination, like Gloden Globe or Oscars but to give the audience, a laughter to enjoy the moment, but all these Critics all the hey think about is if the Movie is worth a nomination or not, always thinking with that mind, never of ""let me get my head out of my ass and just enjoy it at least."""
its sorry to say 21st Century and we still have our heads some were else beside of having a good time and a sense of humor.
Great actors + great storyline = GREAT movie!
"Uneven film with some nice scenes and likeable characters, especially in small roles."
But some scenes just don't work.
"Overall worth seeing, but don't raise your expectations."
A feel good charming movie.
Enjoyed It's Complicated so my husband and I went to see the Intern.
We got the lines since my husband has done most of the items De Niro did in retirement.
"Hathaway, Russo, the interns and Most of all De Niro kept us interested because of the body language used instead of words made this a very believable movie and the chemistry of the actors makes you want to know them even more."
Enjoyed it very much and looking forward to the next movie from Nancy Meyers.
Hysterically and smartly funny!
Such a fun movie.
The audience was roaring with laughter!
It was excellent...I loved it!
"Formulaic, but fun."
De Niro is more charming than I usually find him.
I absolutely love movies like this one!
"I liked the movie, had many funny moments and not at all predictable."
Charming and witty movie that breaks with some conventions that the audience expects to see and thus remains believable.
"There's no denying the fact that Robert DeNiro had a hell of a time making the movie, he *is* the movie and everybody groups around him."
There's also no doubt that he has a wonderful Anne Hathaway at his side who - in my view - excels even in a comedy movie.
"Yes, you could say at times the movie stretches its believability, esp."
"when I mention a certain ""robbery"" - which I could have easily lived without."
"And yes, the focus changes from De Niro to Hathaway in the course of the movie, but the movie is always charming, witty, and it just reminds you of your parents or grandparents and makes you wonder what live has in store for you."
I have enjoyed this movie and rarely have heard so much heartful laughter in an audience.
"This is a great movie, despite what the critics say."
Cute film.
Funny and predictable but cute.
"Ties up perhaps a bit too neatly and it's a decidedly sentimental movie, but there is a genuine beating heart underneath it and DeNiro gives a nuanced, quiet performance."
I thought DeNiro and Hathoway were awesome !
!!!
Enjoyed and all around great movie with a great story line.
Don't believe the critics.
This is one of those warm and cozy movies you'll want to curl up on the couch and watch over and over.
DeNiro and Hathaway are perfection.
"This is a movie of Ben "" who is a 70 years old retired "" salary-man""and Jules who is a young entrepreneur."""
"Salary-man"" is a Japanese word."
The salary-man work at a company for 40 years.
They are very royal and trustworthy.They wake up very early.They wear always necktie and business suit.
They love family.
They work till 60 years old.
These are typical stereotypes of the Japanese salary man.
Robert De Nero played a nice salary man.
Arigato.
"( Japanese ""Thank you"")."
"However, Ben, salaryman is great.After his retirement, he applied for some internship."
"He was not a good at new technology.But he had wisdom, humbleness and experience."
Young workaholic president played by Anne Harthaway was begging to listen to his opinion.Even this salary man got a girl friend.
He encouraged the elderly.
I really enjoyed salary man's success story.
He loves Chinese Tai chi.
It makes him healthy.
"I hope he lives till age of 100 years old.At the end of the movie, Julie joined his Tai Chi lesson.I hope that she enjoy her zen moment!"
"Sayonara( Japanese "" Good Bye')."
"It is a predicable comedy, but the actors were so great it was refreshing."
Loved it!!!!
It was funny and really showed how dismissive our culture is of the older generation...to our own peril.
"Great movie, reminded me of my workplace!"
I'll see it again!!
"A pretty decent flick, though it may do better without some parts."
"Fun, great movie."
Wonderful casting!
"The only way I can possibly explain this low score, is that the critics must have been men."
"And, lo and behold, most are!"
"This movie covered so many modern-day issues and did it seamlessly; (some but not all) re-entering the work force, accessing technology, and most important, stereotypes and the struggle women in the work force still continue to receive and deal with on a day-to-day basis."
"This movie was wonderful and everyone should see it, but women most of all should watch this and be inspired that we can still achieve the dream of being equals in the business world and have a family."
"I really enjoyed ""The Intern,"" but have a quibble about its treatment of middle aged & senior women."
I loved the interaction between DeNiro & the younger men (although he never seemed to get them to want to shave--hey guys ZZ Top is right---every girl is crazy about a sharp-dressed man!)
"I rated this move 3 1/2 for two reasons: the way older women are depicted (as ""raging bitches""--Jules Mom--\ complete buffoons--the intern who couldn't drive--or the pushy, lonely one-night stand--Linda Lavin's character)."
"Older women can also be as suave, well-dressed, & knowledgeable as older men."
I'm tired of seeing women my age used as nothing more than comic relief.
Having Rene Russo as the sole older woman who is sane doesn't balance out the other 3.
I also felt that the movie didn't need a really late (story-wise) plot twist.
"Overall, an enjoyable movie."
"DeNiro's performance shows he can do comedy as well as he can do drama & I didn't want to kill Anne Hathaway 5 minutes in, so she did fine too."
"The young actress playing her daughter is adorable & I would be crushing on the other men in the picture if only they'd shave, tuck in their shirts, & dress sharply."
Did not thought i would like it but i did!
hahaha it was hilarious :D
Funny and charming movie
"After reading all of the so-so reviews of this movie, I had gauged my expectations, and was delighted to see a fun, ironic and (at times) a film with deep insights_x0097_especially into what amount to Horatio Alger stories with a woman playing the head of a start-up dot com."
"The idea that ""she can do it all""-- family, mom, wife and company head is not so much challenged (any more than it would be for a man), but placed into focus."
"In the 1950s-60s, the nose-to-the-grindstone man in the gray flannel suit was seen as a person whose family was ignored at the expense of attention to his family."
This film is refreshing in that it recognizes that concentrating on work over family is not a mortal sin and any problems with spouse and child cannot to blamed on the Type A personality in the family regardless of gender.
Robert De Niro is perfect.
"At 70 he is retired and bored, but he doesn't come across either as a fuddy-duddy Luddite or a swinging grandpa."
"Keeping in mind that the De Niro character was in his 30s when personal computers came on the scene in early 1980s and just 40 when the Mac was released in 1984, computer technology in the home and office is not exactly new."
"Getting used a new type of interface or program does take time, but it is no longer the mystery box it was at one time to the older generation."
"This is a much more intelligent (and fun) movie than I expected; so, if you plan to go 1) lower your expectations 2) pay attention, and 3) enjoy!"
This was somewhat of an incomplete film..
"I really enjoyed the characters and the performances of DeNiro and Hathaway, but the storyline didnt seem to go anywhere and the ending seemed rather abrupt... would have preferred to have more of a resolution at the ending."
Best comedy I have seen in a long long time
This was an excellent film.
Very funny and the story was very good.
My wife and I both really enjoyed it so much we did not want it to end.
Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway have a very good chemistry together.
"Definitely a pleasant, relaxing movie."
"It was a little anticlimactic but it that's okay cuz it was a ""feel good"" kind of movie that made me feel like I was best friends with the main characters."
The soundtrack is super soothing too.
This was a very watchable move.
It was a bit predictable and trite and the ending left something to be desired and it totally went off the rails for one scene in the middle that was unnecessary and did not advance the story at all.
"Deniro and Hathaway were what you would expect: polished, funny etc."
"Unfortunately, the story and directing were enough to keep it from a higher rating."
It was enjoyable for the most part and worth my time seeing however it was not up to the caliber of these two fine actors.
This is a great date movie.
"It's timely, insightful, and sweet."
"Professional critics seem to dislike it because, in their jaded view, it doesn't have enough conflict."
"It is subtle, funny, and joyously-devoid of unncessary distraction or villany."
"I bonded with several characters, and wanted to see them succeed."
"A fine, uplifting, enjoyable story, and a nice, clean diversion for an evening"
"Sweet, funny, vulnerable, non-groundbreaking, unpretentious, heart warming."
Much was done right about character portrayal.
"By the way, I endorse the 7 hours of sleep."
"Tries to make a statement about seniors still having value to society and the challenges women face when trying to run a company, but never really hits the nail on the head."
"Still, the performances were great."
"It wasn't completely shown in the trailer as I originally suspected, but most of it was there."
"I liked the movie but, the ending was left to vague for me taste."
"I'm 62 retired Business owner who really feels this movie message is that even today, there is untapped wisdom, that we can give to younger generation, and keep them centered on the right path."
Some say it's mentoring I say it is a s a guardian angle.
But other will see this as another New York movie.
the characters showed they were human and had emotion.
Hug
It was so good.
Critics are idiots.
We enjoyed the film very much.
Mr. DeNiro and Anne exuded great chemistry.
At the end of the film a portion of the audience clamped with approval.
"""The intern"" is a great motion picture that draws comparisons between contemporary society and society of the past."
"In addition to the fact that this film exemplifies issues of modern day society, it does a phenomenal job of providing the audience with what seems to be perpetual laughter."
Refreshing and heart-warming
"Almost too sweet, but I had all the feels and had all the laughs."
It really couldn't have been much more perfect.
Best feel good movie I've seen in a long time!!
Such a great feel-good movie about someone making a difference in someone else's life.
Loved it; reminded me of all the positive qualities of my own Dad.
Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway work very well together!
A great feel-good movie with a lot of laughs and a good message on staying true to yourself
"Funny, predictable but thoroughly entertaining, mainly because Hathaway acted her little heart out in this film."
Kept a smile on the audiences faces and audible chuckles and laughter the entire film spell successful entertainment!
A very cute movie.
"Three uses (implied and verbal) of the F word, one sexual innuendo, and that's pretty much it as far as objectionable content goes."
Great movie for a date night.
If I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of the ending.
Totally unreal but overall great movie
"Excellent movie, Crystal and I both loved this show."
You have to go see it!
A refreshingly good story!
"A very enjoyable movie...no surprises, just a nice time."
old people will love this
I liked the concept of the movie.
Robert De Niro and Anne Hathway have a great chemistry as colleagues.
My only critiques of the movie is the way that the ending was handled and the development of De Niro's character.
It seemed like the director left a significant number of scenes on the cutting room floor towards the end to cut the length of the movie.
More could have been done with De Niro's character in terms of his experience to help the young CEO as a trusted adviser.
You seem a glimpse of that angle when De Niro's character does some brief business analysis.
"Overall, it was a good movie that I'd own on DVD."
It deserves a higher rating than the 56% on Rotten Tomatoes.
It had several sad moments but overall it was a very nice feel good type of movie!
Terrific acting by Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro
Very good!
"Great movie, Amazing performances that makes you feel."
Great movie with great heart!
This is the kind of movie we need.
Anne Hathaway is charming and Robert DeNiro is heartwarming.
Go.
See.
It.
It's a feel good cute movie that everyone in the theater loved!
All working moms who are working to have it all should see this movie!
It was much more than I thought it would be.
"I thought it would be a silly fun chick flick, but it was thoughtful, funny and touching."
"The 2 main characters were both more than the usual fare, and both were played effectively by the actors."
I highly recommend this movie!
Fabulous.
Don't miss it.
Wonderful insightful movie.
Too bad there are not more like it.
"So many important topics such as, stay-at-home Dads, Seniors in the work place, younger verses older generation, and life after the death of a spouse, were told in a beautiful sensitive way."
Very touching.
Everyone in our group was very moved.
Bravo Nancy Meyers I'm so glad your there.
You nailed it.
Your movies are wonderful!
Keep up the good work.
"Avery peaceful and enjoyable movie with a few predictable moments, but a welcomed slower pace compared to the summer blockbusters this year."
"Fabulous movie -- feel good, sad, hysterically funny and a must see movie."
What is there not to like about DeNiro?
2 great actors & that's it!
Long not funny Save your money
I was very excited to see this movie.
"It looked funny, had great stars in leading roles, and looked like it had potential to be very good."
"After reading your Rotten Tomatoes critic score, we almost did not even bother to see it - your critique was so bad that we were really disappointed."
We decided to see it anyway and am so glad we did.
"It was funny, feel good, and overall one of the best movies I have seen this year!"
"A satisfying drama/comedy about the relationships between the old and wise and the young and wide-eyed, 'The Intern' delivers great performances, and a simple story to chew on."
Excellent characters.
"The story is not a surprize, but runs a thin line between predictable and novel."
"The story follows the best possible track, which elevates it from average to really good."
Uplifting.
"This is probably the third best Nancy Myers movie I've seen (Behind ""It's Complicated"" and ""Something's Gotta Give"")."
"Myers is exceptional at attracting top rate talent to her movies (See, DeNiro and Hathaway for this one; Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin for ""Complicated"" and Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton for ""Give."")"
She also gets excellent performances from the talent.
The story casting and story telling fall down a bit on this one.
"Myers seems not really to know how to get a story to the end, a failing the other two movies had as well."
"That said, you will greatly enjoy the relationship between DeNiro and Hathaway."
DeNiro's relationship with some younger male interns (young enough to be his grandsons) is also very funny.
"Of course, in Myers world, even the ""poor"" people aren't really poor, but you know that going in."
Goodness reading a few of these reviews I have to wonder why some people can't just go see a movie without critiquing everything from wifi to pajamas showing or not showing to the scene at the moms house.
I loved the movie.
"It was hilarious in places, touching in others."
You go to the movies for escapism.
Embrace it..
Entertaining.
Good chemistry with actors.
Sexual overtones was decent.
The best actors with a great story that everyone can relate to.
Very cute movie.
The chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro was so sweet.
We will see it again.
Kind of quirky.
Definitely funny.
"Excellent casting, except for Anne Hathaway's husband."
"It is entertaining for any adult, but optimal viewing age is 35+."
Many of the jokes are better if you some life experience.
i think i get it.
"he's old, right?"
De Niro is endearing but it drags.
This is why you can't rely on the professional reviewers.
Only 55% like this?
Ha!
Jerks.
It's a funny & entertaining flick that will get you laughing and crying.
De Niro has been awful in many similar movies but he went back to his 1995 self and is really good in this.
I loved this movie so much!
I wanted to turn around and watch it again once it ended.
The chemistry between Anne and Robert was perfect on screen.
DeNiro is hilarious and heartwarming.
Nancy Meyers always outdoes herself with set design.
A movie for all ages...even the kids in the theater were laughing.
Ann Hathaway and DeNiro are great together.
There's a great wealth of knowledge in our Seniors that can balance our world.
It was a wonderful movie.
We loved it.
Right up there with my all time favorites
"Very good movie, just a poor ending."
"""It's pure fluff and its pretty much everything you would probably expect it to be."
But Robert De Niro is wonderful of course.
Anne Hathaway is terrific as usual (and my definition of smokin hot).
"It's funny enough, sweet, and charming."
It's there to make you smile.
"And I did."""
"Funny, sweet and tear jerker all rolled into one."
pretty light.
not a forgiving portrayal of career women.
Better than expected.
Simple.
Original.
Inteligent.
Adorable!
A very good and smart comedy as we haven't seen for so long.
"The Intern is another bourgeous, conservative film from Nancy Myers."
"The old ways are best, she believes, although money and nice houses can help us abide all that's wrong with the world, especially the presence of those with little taste for the finer things."
"And, by the way, Nancy Myers did not direct ""As Good As It Gets,"" despite what Armelle C seems to believe."
The trailers made it seem like a comedy but it was quite more in actuality.
Great acting and chemistry by De Niro and Hathaway.
A very creative story for adults of all ages.
"Sweet movie, recommended!"
"The new Nancy Meyers' film (so waiting for) is as perfect as her past movies ""As Good As it Gets"", ""What Women Want"" and ""Something's Gotta Give"" were in the romantic comedy department."
I won't spoil anything.
De Niro is fantastic.
Totally recommended.
This was a very good movie!
It was great!
I thought De Niro was funny and played his part well.
The Intern is both cute and refreshing.
Everyone in the theatre seemed as if they were reacting to what was on screening.
I've worked for a couple of tech companies and this movie hits that nail on the head.
Anne was fantastic!
Di Niro was adorable.
Only one minor storyline I couldn't buy in to but otherwise I loved it!
I'm not going for big words here!!!
"this movie makes you feel good, and thats rare I would say."
"When you come out after 2 hours, you will be left with a refreshed mind."
Thats what matters above all .
Definitely worth a watch.
A well written tear jerk-er.
DeNiro and Hathaway shine in uncharacteristic roles.
Great date flick.
Great feel good movie!
Robert De Nero was amazing and reminded me of my dad.
It was funny and very entertaining.
I think this film isnt bad as you assumed !
"When i watched in from the beginning until the end, yah, i'm enjoyed, maybe because of the themed so closely with my own experince."
"I relly impressed about the story line, i worked in start up company too and i know her feeling and i love ben, he so humble !"
"The entire movie is painfully lazy old people jokes and references to De Niro's characters age and a painful repetitive attempt at making a ""new generation"" kind of pop culture, millennial movie."
Both of the main actors as you already know are Oscar winners!!
Why either would settle for this pandering lowest common denominator turd is beyond me.
I guess De Niro and Hathaway are doing worse financially then I thought
My daughter and I loved it.
"It's a fun, feel good movie."
My wife and I both loved this movie.
The relationships are fantastic and not forced.
The acting is great.
The feeling is real.
It doesn't feel contrived like so many others like it.
Truly an excellent movie with depth and balance.
"Funny, heart felt, encouraging and joyous."
It's no wonder the critics didn't like it.
This movie was great!
Thoroughly enjoyed Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway gave stellar performances.
The overall theory of The story is good.
Somewhere it fell flat though.
"Despite Robert DeNiro's lovable character, the story didn't reach out and suck me in."
"Good performance by Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway(and even have a chemistry with each others), fresh music score by Theodore Shapiro, nice interior office design."
"But unfortunately, the script wasn't quite solid, partly messy plots, and silly sense of humors."
"I liked Nancy Meyers' previous works, like ""What Women Want"" and ""Something's Gotta Give"", but now this one was so a bit disappointed."
"Great, feel good movie :)"
It's all carried by the leads.
But it took a while for the story to launch and then it just didn't do much but keep a steady pace...
Sentimental at heart and feminist in intention (but not very succesful).
"Hilarious, warm to the heart, and just a pleasant movie to watch."
absolutely loved this movie.
De Niro can still carry a film.
Very entertaining!
I am a huge Nancy Meyers fan and wanted to LOVE this movie.
But it just didn't take me anywhere.
There isn't a thing wrong with it.
The cast was excellent.
Some good points were made along the way.
"Perhaps it was just a little too ""pat""...DeNiro's character was just too ""together"", always with the right comeback and always with ahandkerchief....as if a handkerchief is the solution to world peace."
"Anyway, it's good."
It's light.
It's fine.
It's just not GREAT.
"Really good movie for a good date night or with the family, cast was great one of my favorite robert de niro performances and great chemistry between him and ann Hathaway all in all I had a good time watching this :)"
Here's a movie you want to see if you need to believe in tooth fairies and unicorns.
"It's sickly sweet, boring, predictable and otherwise un-watchable."
"Every character is feminized to the max to make them acceptable and PC: the blundering, moronic eunuch males who play DeNiro's young intern colleagues, the crying, publicly emotional women and DeNiro himself, whose character's pandering to the ""young, hip"" boss tries so hard to be justified by this boring and predictable script."
"If this movie makes any statements, the key takeaway is that being pathetic gets you ahead in life."
Blecch.
A sweet movie.
The chemistry between de Niro and Hathaway was very good and very appropriate.
One of my all-time favorite movies
Old people are old!
Young people work too much and don't sleep!
Yuk yuk yuk.
The best movie I have seen in such a long time.
"The Intern is a thoughtful, entertaining and well-written film."
My only knock is that despite the fact that it is two hours in length it felt somehow incomplete- like several chapters in the middle of a book.
A combination of true feminism and self-confidence rolled into one.
It conveys inspiration to the younger generation and gives the oldest a few laughs.
Truly a must-see film of the year.
Original storyline!
De Niro's character is admirable and enjoyable but not believable.
Same for Anne Hathaway's.
The movie started out fun but got overly long and a little too heavy for its britches.
Not bad overall.
"3.5/5* or 7.5/10 Being a gentleman, having true class, women empowerment, how life doesn't end after a certain age and how to deal with real life relationships are all things a film like The Intern deals with."
"The Intern is the definition of feel good cinema, I can guarantee you that throughout the film you will be smiling, and there so many instances the film is just so heart touching.But what really works for the film is the lead cast of Robert D'Niro who is only getting better with age, and Anne Hathaway who is epitome of really beauty."
There chemistry is just perfect.
"Story wise the film talks about a 70 year old man named Ben, he is officially retired, and is a widower."
"After traveling the globe for awhile, he is back home and hates thinking about living at home all day,so he keeps himself busy all the time, sometimes he goes to visit his kids, or goes to starbucks etc."
"Until one day he learns of a opportunity to become a senior Intern at a online fashion company, and he pounces at the opportunity."
"He eventually gets the job, and meets the owner of the company Jules."
"Jules is a young but busy women running a company by herself, and she has a family which her stay at home husband runs."
How the not so tech savy senior intern Ben comes into Jules's life and helps her in her journey is what the film is about.
"Acting wise, I must say Robert D'Niro steals the show, his character is so well written, and he embodies the traits of being a classy gentleman wonderfully."
"Anne Hathaway looks so beautiful, but more importantly gives a superb,mature act.The rest of supporting cast has done a great job, and is casted perfectly."
"The Intern is a movie made for a mature audience, and while the film has many laughs, the films undertone meanings are what really win your heart."
I truly loved how the film dealt with the message of women empowerment in such a fresh but beautiful way.
"And one of the films major assets was how the character of Robert D'Niro was written, how even after being 70 he is still enjoying his life to the fullest, and how he is a true gentleman."
"I mean for me the film really didn't have any negatives other than the place slackened a bit towards the end Overall The Intern is not a pathbreaking film, but the film truly lived up to its amazing trailer.Its nice to see a film deal with real life situations, in a beautiful, light manner and not be so serious and sad."
"Its a film I throughly enjoyed without any hiccups, and its a film I highly recommend, you get your tickets worth in just seeing the chemistry between D'Niro and Hathaway."
3.5/5* or 7.5/10
"For you simple people like me, it's good!"
Go watch!
"Great movie that presents a message that a youth oriented society needs to hear, but presents it in a fun and entertaining way."
"The acting was truly exceptional, particular by Anne Hathaway."
Good story and well written
I loved this movie!
I understand that some of the critics say it's about the privileged.True!
It could use some diversity as well.
But I loved the story line!
I loved the characters!
It was a nice day at the movies!
"The ending is quiet abrupt, and I'm not sure why."
That is my only critique.
"It's a nice, feel good movie devoid of porn sex and only a couple of expletives."
"For my money, that alone made it worthwhile."
"However, it's a good storyline that showcases the contributions of the older generation that, sadly, the American culture attempts to marginalize."
The lessons each generation give the other and the friendships that develop are well played.
I liked being able to sit through a movie without the crap that tries to substitute itself for decent writing these days.
The only thing I would change is the abruptness of the ending.
"They should just start naming these kinds movies ""White People Problems ""."
The lack of people of color in this movie is only half the problem.
This movie made me nauseous.
This movie is not based in any reality.
It pretends that a woman (or man) can have it all without consequences.
Who writes this stuff?
Horrible boss.
"Skip ""Go"" and go to jail."
Who sends employees out to commit a crime?
"Who calls their mother a ""terrorist"", but cannot man-up to doing it."
There are sharks at the top of the business world that would eat her alive in real life.
If it is unbelievable it is not very entertaining.
This picture shows three generations of stupid spoiled bratty women.
Does the world really need that?
This is a wonderful movie.
"I'm not surprised that the critics don't like it, they are one jaded group."
If the movie doesn't have violence or sex or some kind of a crazy situation they're just not happy.
"This is a great movie and it's worth seeing, Great date movie."
"+Anne Hathaway glows in ""The Intern"" whether she is leading 200+ employees of a company she founded or getting drunk and throwing up into a dumpster or crying when she has been betrayed or any of the many emotions she experiences in this 2 hour movie."
"On the other hand it is time Robert De Niro gave up broad comedies as he is only repeating every movement and mugging face he has made since ""Analyze This"", ""Meet The Parents"" and ""Meet The Frockers""."
He has made many comedies throughout his career but for the past decade and a half it seems he wants to be Jerry Lewis!
"For a comedy ""The Intern"" is only mildly amusing with the funniest scene having nothing to do with advancing the plot but a 'breaking and entering' mission, which was written, and directed, by Nancy Meyers who has had success with previous films dealing with whether a woman can 'have it all'."
Most of the film was made in Brooklyn showing the New York borough as green and sparkling and having an empty parking spot for any in the cast of the film.
The various supporting characters from Anders Holm as Hathaway's stay at home husband and dad to their very precocious daughter JoJo Kushner to Rene Russo as a love interest for De Niro--whew!
"No, not Hathaway!"
"Among young employees in Hathaway's company Peter Vack, Andrew Rannells, Nat Wolff along with Linda Lavin, Zack Pearlman and Christina Holtan and others do what they can with the material given them."
"""The Intern"" is a pleasant movie but drags in spots and touches on subjects without following through such as Hathaway's relationship with her mother."
"Oh yes I don't ever remember seeing so many pillows on beds, decorative or utilitarian, whether in a home or a hotel!"
One of the sweetest movies you may ever see.
The Intern exudes charm at every turn and drags you in from the first few scenes.
The acting was near perfection and I completely forgot I was watching Anne Hathaway and Robert de Niro almost immediately.
The writing was very nearly flawless except for the husband character who needed some work.
"The film will bring laughs, smiles and may even hit you right in the feels as you sit through a very fast two hour story with a soundtrack that makes you feel incredibly comfortable."
The Intern is absolutely one of my top movies of the year.
"What I got to say about ""The Intern"" is a good comedy movie from start to finish."
"""It's hilarious, moving and heartfelt."""
The performances by the whole cast is really good.
"""Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro has outstanding chemistry in this movie."
The directing and screenplay by Nancy Meyers is phenomenal.
The cinematography is good.
The score in this I will say I like it so much.
"""I have to repot that ""The Intern"" is a one laugh out loud movie that will have your body hurting just of the humor in this movie that is so funny that you don't want to miss."
"I'm raving that on the top of my head, I'm saying that this movie is year's funniest comedy that I laugh so hard in so far this year!"
"-- So in words it's a must see movie."""
Robert DeNero was fantastic!
"A little long and drawn out, but has the right amount of cuteness and heart."
One that makes you leave the movie feeling good..
Funny movie and awesome to see
Robert DeNiro is considered one of America's Best actors but the movie shows he is trying to change all that!
"After making crappy movies, he follows it up with this crap!"
it's over Bobby!
What a fun movie.
And my dad carried a hankie all my life.
"I've never seen a movie with Anne Hathaway, that I didn't love."
It was a pleasurable 2 hours.
Love this movie it was well played and had the right amount of humor but still predictable.
I enjoyed even though I knew what was coming next.
Right amount of humor and seriousness √∞'?√∞?
1/2√∞'?√∞?

good old fashioned schmaltz updated to blog society.
About 45 minutes too long.
"""Background"" music more prominent than dialogue."
Enough cliches to fill a book.
Don't need to be alerted by music when there is an emotional moment.
"We can figure it out, Nancy."
Haven't laughed out loud so much in a very long time.
Side splitting.
"The Intern is your standard romantic comedy, without the leads having the romance, which works because that would just be awkward, unless your Hugh Hefner or Donald Trump."
"While it doesn't do anything different for the genre, it's got great acting, with Hathaway and De Niro having great chemistry."
"The plot was good, the drama a bit over the top, and the ending is a big ?"
"The humor was great, especially when employees asked De Niro if they needed to speak louder so he could hear them."
"I really wished he would have responded ""You Talking To Me?"""
"Kind of a chick flick, but it was good for a change."
"No guns, no killing, just life as it is lived."
It was fun to go to a good baby boomer movie with my wife and actually laugh.
"Who wouldn't want to go see a comedy with Anne, Robert, and Renee."
We loved it!!
"Well, I was gonna say intern slash best friend."
Missed opportunity around 2nd careers and multigenerational relationships.
This was a really thoughtful and refreshing movie.
We enjoyed every moment!
"Sometimes you don't need a film to try and change the world, make bold political or societal statements or even be shocking."
"Sometimes it's good enough to be an audience member who can just sit back, relax and enjoy the show... and smile."
"That's the kind of movie you get when you sit down to enjoy ""The Intern"" (PG-13, 2:01)."
"Robert DeNiro plays the title character, a retired 70 year-old widower who has become bored with his life."
"After 40 years in the business of printing telephone books and then losing his beloved wife of 42 years, he did his best to adjust to his new life, and it worked - for a while."
"He traveled the world and engaged in a wide variety of physical and intellectual pursuits to keep himself occupied, but it wasn't enough."
"When walking the streets of his native Brooklyn, he sees a flyer for a senior intern program at a young, but burgeoning internet clothing company."
Ben feels that learning more about technology and working with young people feels like just the challenge he needs to occupy his mind and his time.
"He applies, via a terrific self-made video (the company's requirement), and sits through a series of amusing interviews with company employees young enough to be his grandchildren... and he gets the internship."
"Ben ends up working directly for the company's very capable, but over-extended founder, played by Anne Hathaway."
"The senior intern program was her idea, but Jules is initially hesitant to deal with Ben personally on a daily basis."
She's a perfectionist who's constantly on the go.
She's difficult to work for and she knows it.
"She loves and respects all 220 of her employees, but her motto might as well be ""If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself."""
"Yet, it's hard to resist Ben's earnestness, strong work ethic and wise, calming presence."
"After a little awkwardness as Ben and Jules both try to figure out how he can best serve his new boss, he ends up becoming her driver."
"In this capacity, he gets to know Jules' stay-at-home husband (Anders Holm), their precocious, but adorable young daughter (JoJo Kushner) and, most importantly, Jules herself, in all her earnestness, anxiety and vulnerability."
"It turns out that, at this stage of the game, Jules needs Ben's wisdom and support more than she'd be willing to admit - to him or herself."
Her company is growing so fast and she's so hands-on that one of her assistants (Andrew Rannells) tells her that the investors would like to see her take on a CEO.
"This would lighten her load, but it would also mean effectively giving control of her company to someone else."
"She half-heartedly interviews people to be her potential boss, not sure that this is the best move, but wanting to do right by her employees and her marriage, which is starting to suffer due to the demands of her very busy schedule."
"In the midst of all this, Ben becomes a sounding board and occasional advice dispenser for Jules, a very helpful co-worker and kind of pseudo uncle to a small group of the company's young employees (played by Adam DeVine, Zack Pearlman, Jason Orley and Christina Scherer) and a possible love interest for the company's full-time in-house masseuse (Rene Russo)."
"Ben is at the story's center, but it's the great mix of interesting characters and subplots that makes this movie so worthwhile."
"DeNiro has rarely been more pleasant to watch, or Hathaway so winning, as they lead an ensemble cast that complements each other wonderfully."
"Nancy Myers' amusing and purposeful script and direction highlight the virtues of women making the most of their lives, but never hits us over the head with her message."
Jules is simply a modern woman who's very likeable and subtly inspiring.
"A scene in which some of Jules' employees break the law to help her with a pressing personal problem is fun, but seems misplaced, and the resolutions to some of the story's conflicts seem a little trite, but, overall, this is simply a delightful film that I'd recommend to anyone."
"""The Intern"" isn't perfect, but is definitely worth having around."
"""A-"""
"The Intern is a simple, predictable movie--an old gentleman who wants a life meets a young person who is lost, and they eventually sort things out with some tears on the side."
"However, that's one of the major factor that made me like this movie."
"It's charming, cute, makes you laugh, and these things never get old."
"I know this might get some criticism for its cheesiness and its simplicity, but it's a good drama movie that makes you smile (probably what it's meant to do) and, honestly, I don't really expect much more in this area."
"It does its job, most movies fail to do so; maybe not a 'great' movie, but a good one."
A flat out bad movie.
"DeNiro back in form, charming feel good movie :)"
warning this movie is not a comedy as advertised there are some funny bits in it however all in all it is more about a woman and her struggles
√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???
loved this movie!!!!
Going to see it again today!
A movie worth seeing multiple times.
A warm and funny movie with Great chemistry among all cast members.
It bridges the gap between young and old and shows that everyone has something to offer.
A good fun film with its main talented and charismatic characters.
"Ah, Nancy!"
"For years now (in films like¬†""What Women Want,""¬†""The Holiday"" and¬†""It's Complicated""),¬†you have been writing and directing films that put women front and center - professional women, with impressive credentials¬†- only to undermine the power of that image¬†with a strange brand of (unintentional?)"
misogyny.
"On the surface, your films look, at first,¬†like¬†feminist confections, but then you always end up¬†trafficking in the worst kind of feminine stereotypes."
"No matter what their strengths and achievements, your protagonists are inevitably emotional, irrational, and in need of a man to make things right."
"Even a career woman needs love, no matter what the cost, you always remind us."
"At least in¬†""Something's Gotta Give""¬†- my favorite of yours - you bring the man down a peg as much as the woman."
How broadminded of you ...
"In¬†""The Intern,"" Meyers¬†turns things around (a bit), taking the perfect man and turning him into good ole Dad - or, at least, a father figure - in the form of Robert De Niro, who once wowed the world with his kinetic energy in films like¬†""Taxi Driver,"" and now spends his time mugging for the camera in films like¬†""Last Vegas""¬†(and¬†""The Intern"")."
"De Niro plays 70-ish Ben, who was once an executive at a phonebook (remember those?)"
company and is now a retired widower in need of something to fill his days.
"When he sees a flyer advertising a ""senior intern"" program at a local (Brooklyn, NY) e-commerce company, he jumps at the chance to apply, just to have something to do."
"The movie opens with Ben recording his application video, intercut with a montage of his present-day life, which includes a trip to San Francisco to see his son and grandchildren and, back home, an awkward exchange with a local widow - played by a very funny, if under-utilized, Linda Lavin (of ""Alice"" fame) - who has her own plan for how to cure Ben's loneliness."
"Lo and behold, the company - an internet fashion retailer called ""About the Fit"" - calls Ben in, and he gets the gig."
"If it all seems a bit easy, it is, helped along by the usual easy-listening soundtrack¬†of composer Theodore Shapiro (""We're the Millers"")."
"Still,¬†De Niro, hamminess aside, is pleasant enough to watch, and there are a few gags that score."
"So what is a ""senior intern"" to do?"
"Well, no one knows, really, least of all the founder and CEO of the company, 30-ish Jules - played by Anne Hathaway (""Interstellar"") with her usual spunk - but Ben is assigned to her, anyway."
"She ignores him, until Ben makes himself so indispensable to the entire office (he's that just that kind of guy) that she just has to take notice, and before long he is driving her to and from work, watching her kid, and spending time in her (amazing) Brooklyn brownstone¬†with house-husband (sorry, ""stay-at-home dad,"" as Jules corrects Ben) Matt - a very forgettable Anders Holm (""Unexpected"")."
And why does Jules - successful internet mogul that she is - need and respond to this new older masculine presence?
"Well, it turns out that all is not perfect at home or at work: she never sees hubby, and when she does, they're both too tired to talk or get it on; she can't spend even the minimal time with her daughter that she should; and her investors think she should take on a ""real"" (male) CEO to allow her to work less and focus on the company's vision."
"Since what we see on the screen kind of supports these facts and assessments of her performance (maybe not the male CEO part), it's hard not to agree that, yes, she needs help."
"And with Ben so competent, he's just the fellow to save the day."
"It's all relatively harmless, and occasionally touching and funny, but all to often it's just a little regressive for my taste."
"Ben even finds a more appropriate - for Meyers' taste - love interest in the form of the beautiful office masseuse played by Rene Russo (Nightcrawler), charming as ever, and, of course, 11 years younger than Ben (Lavin's character is just too old and pushy)."
"If the film were 30 minutes shorter and with all of the¬†exposition cut out - Ben to Jules, ""You can do it on your own"" - it might be more watchable and I might forgive it its faults in the breezy rush to the finish line."
"But so often, it's a bit of¬†a slog."
"Then again, if you've loved every other Nancy Meyers film, then you might be used to her aesthetic and not mind any of it."
"If so, then go see it in the full confidence that the director is true to her own legacy."
"The Guardian's Jordan Hoffman writes that The Intern is a ""chain of predictable sequences shot in a flat manner."""
THIS IS THE INTERN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE.
Stop trying to over analyze it and just enjoy it for what it is: enjoyable.
The relationship between DeNiro and Russo could be explored a bit further.
"The movie is a nice, feel-good movie for the autumn times."
"Father of the Bride 1 & 2, The Parent Trap, What Woman Want and Something's Gotta Give."
Some of my favorite feel-good/rom-com films from the past.
"They all have one thing in common, they're directed by the great Nancy Meyers."
Meyers is one of the director's that every time she releases a film I'm always super excited to check it out because it could become a Nancy Meyers classic like the films listed above.
Is this a Nancy Meyers classic?
Yes and No.
First off I must start by saying I enjoyed this film.
"It's a funny, charming and breezy."
"The performances by De Niro, Hathaway and Rene Russo are great, and kudos to Meyers for bringing out a solid performance out of De Niro that shows that he can still be great when he tries."
The film also looks nice and boasts a fun score that's straight out of the '90s.
"It was heartfelt, inspiring and surprising at times and then at other times the film gets lost tonally and suffers ""at times"" because of it."
There's something so great about seeing a film that has a strong female lead and showcases female empowerment in such an honest and relatable way.
Also a film that shows that no matter your age you never lose your value.
"Even though the film veers off its familiar but enjoyable path from time-to-time, and I'm sorry Workaholics fans but Anders Holm was so miscast and delivered the worst performance I've probably seen all year."
And also the ending is so abrupt and story lines are left in limbo and never wrapped up.
"SO, besides a few glaring negatives and some major and minor bumps in the road this is still an enjoyable at times and I can see certain audience members being very moved and uplifted by it especially if they can relate to the characters."
"Also, the film introduces JoJo Kushner in her first ever theatrical movie role and she just might be the cutest child actor ever that had great chemistry and line delivery, I'm sure we'll be seeing more from her in the future."
"Overall, I'll just barely give THE INTERN a 6 out of 10."
It's a decent matinee film and if you're a Nancy Meyers fan there will be enough familiarity there to enjoy.
Just don't pay too much for it and expect a Nancy Meyers classic and you'll be film.
It was very nice!
Very enjoyable!
Anne was great and Robert was adorable?!
LoL!
It was very enjoyable!
Dad was the weakest character though.
My husband & I enjoyed The Intern very much.
"It's fairly predictable, but Robert DeNiro & Anne Hathaway have great chemistry & it was fun to watch them."
We give it two thumbs up!
10
This was really a fantastic movie.
A perfect date night movie.
I belly laughed often.
Great natural comedy.
I knew it would be good but it was better than I expected.
Anne Hathaway is a superb actress and I loved Robert DeNiro too.
Their chemistry was perfection and loved the supporting cast too.
The little girl who played Anne's daughter was a joy to watch.
I'm glad she was in fair amount of scenes.
"Not sure why the critics didn't love it, but listen to the users!"
Pleasantly surprising drama full of joyful moments
"Muy buena, hay que tomarse su tiempo."
"nothing great by any means but very sharp acting from both Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway experience lies both in old and young people in the work-force even a senior intern like Ben gives out plenty of life-lessons and wisdom for someone like Jules who has so much pressure on her with constantly working and holding her marriage together a lot of points are talked about as well from sexism in the workplace to men going from such simple beings to clueless fools today there's a few laughs to be had and some emotional scenes to really have people see the big picture it's a tad too long but a film such as this teaches us that you can still learn so much no matter what age range life starts then ends, everyone wants to do an honest day's work, and the world may have changed but everyone can still contribute"
By far the BEST chic flic movie I've seen all year!
"This is mostly harmless, emphasis on that first word."
This is a typical Nancy Meyers film.
"Basic plot you can probably guess from the trailer: DeNiro comes in on the plot contrivance of an older intern program, and ends up helping Hatheway overcome her stress from running her company and trying to maintain her family life with a stay-at-home dad, with the main conflict being whether or not she'll hire an experienced CEO to help run the company."
"What follows is often amusing albeit a pretty standard plot, which is reasonably well acted, and charming enough that you can probably tell if you'll like the movie just from the trailer."
"Now, about that emphasis: two elements of this film made me cringe, and I'm not talking about the occasional joke that didn't work for me."
"The first is that at one point DeNiro and some of the other interns commit a felony, with Hatheway's knowledge and endorsement, in order to save her some embarrassment from her mother."
Is this supposed to show she's competent at running her company?
"The mother character is completely superfluous to the plot; she's only there to be a nag on the phone, is never seen, and could have easily been written out of the plot."
"The second I won't get into too much detail about, but suffice to say it's presented as being empowering to Hatheway but instead came off, to me, as trite, cliche, and disempowering and playing to stereotypes."
In other words: typical Nancy Meyers.
Ugh.
"If that bothers you less than me, then you may have fun with this."
"Personally, those bits that bothered me could have been cut or reshaped, giving a shorter runtime (2 hours is pushing it for what is essentially a comedy), leading to a slightly above middling score."
Saccharine and predictable.
DeNiro does comedy as well as anyone.
As an intern in a senior program this cutesy movie is a good sunday afternoon diversion.
Anne Hathaway is weak as the founder and chief of the company.
Some of it is really far fetched but I enjoyed it and recommend it.
"The intern brings nothing new and is slightly overlong, but it's a charming little treat for comedy fans, and is one of Robert De Niro's better late period movies in a while."
The Intern with Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway is a very nice comedy/drama movie.
It has a lot of funny and feel good moments.
A good watch!
Great move really enjoyed it I would encourage other people to see it to
Almost lost their way on its simple storyline but the actors and their simple movements delivered the film to a nice and enjoyable movie.
Perfect casting and good story.
It's an nicely baked movie.
this movie is hilarious!!
"The films screenplay leaves lot to be desired in terms of climax, not getting to know characters of the film totally."
But what makes you sit and watch is the sweetness of the film.
A nice movie to see.
What a lovely movie!
"All the emotions are felt in this motion picture, sadness, love, anger, and of course happiness."
It's another stunner by Nancy - a fantastic feel good film.
LOVED IT
Only Nancy Meyers can give us a humerus look at ageism in the work place.
Anne Hathaway and Robert DeNiro make a perfect on screen duo.
A very sweet and heartfelt movie.
Even my sons were into it.
"Finally a movie of that director and writer Nancy Meyers don't screw the final act, The Intern is easy one of her best movies, mature, well acted (the chemistry between Robert De Niro e Anne Hathaway is amazing), well directed and very funny, this comedy for adult deliver a good enternainment moments for the audience."
(4/5)
A sweet movie with a little girl power and parental figure bonding worked in.
"If you don't like a little sentimentality, I don't know what you were thinking watching this movie."
"If you saw the trailer, you should have known what you were in for."
I on the other hand loved it.
"It was cute, sweet and grown up."
"As to expect from Meyers, a kind and sweet comedy with charismatic characters and a touching story."
"Hathaway and De Niro make a great team on screen and teach us about friendship, family, love and work, along with the rest of the cast."
The script is generally well developed and the final result is a crowd-pleaser that will earn the audience's love right away.
"If you're looking for laughs, then you'll enjoy ""The Intern."""
It's nice to see Robert DeNiro in a roll that makes you laugh.
"Not roar, more of a snicker."
"A cute story, yet very predicable."
"Anne Hathaway is the perfect co-star, in this movie for DeNiro."
Great date night movie.
It was a nice heartwarming movie.
A good mix of humor and seriousness.
Loved all the characters.
The little girl was sweet.
Ben was a positive role model on a younger generation of men.
Tuck in your shirt guys and make sure you have a handkerchief.
"Genuinely funny and heartfelt, powered by strong charm and chemistry between Oscar winners Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway."
Full review: http://bit.ly/1gO5ZEe
Like it was said the main if not the only benefit of the film is its two leads.
"""The Intern"" is a film where you can predict the ending, but the ride is worth it."
"""The Intern"" does what many current movies fail at and that's make you love the characters."
"Yes, it may hit your over the head with its specific message a few times in the movie, but the rest of the movie makes up for it."
"Lovable characters, great acting, charming dialog and scenes that take you by surprise and have you laughing out loud."
"Let's face it, this one will entertain the masses but with no real redeeming value, kind of like a big tub of popcorn..., it's delicious to consume but no real nutritional value either."
It was fun to watch the chemistry between the various actors and there were some very funny moments.
It's a safe choice when looking for entertaining cinema.
"a great film about a man, DeNiro, who attempts to get back in the business life style."
"Still he meets a girl oriented girl, Hatheway."
Overall a rather well done film!
"""The Intern"" after thoughts: Completely loved this film from start to end!!!"
Anne & Robert's chemistry was on point!
"The blended mix of classy old school vibe (handkerchiefs), successful business savvy, new look of traditional family today, & just a simply story with some unique twist with Brooklyn NY flare as a backdrop couldn't have made this anymore perfect!"
"Memorable cast: Adam D, Andrew R, Zack P, Rene R (we are call Massage Therapist!"
Other term is a No No!
"), and others!"
"You want to laugh & feel other emotions, this is the one!!!"
I want to take this film & get in my PJ's & watch it again by a roarin fire on Christmas!
MUST SEE!!!

?¬º or 5 (5 of 5)
"When I first heard about this concept, I was intreged and when I watched the first trailer, I was actually excited to see this film."
"When I got a chance to go and watch the movie four days before it came out, I jumped at the chance and I'm glad I did."
This film was so charming.
"It shows that even though they may be a difference in generation, there are some things that we can relate to, young and old."
It had comedic moments which was great and Robert De Niro's character is so likeable.
What I loved the most about this movie is how a women is portrayed.
"With films such as Suffurgettes and the last Hunger Games coming out, we need more movies about powerful women."
Anne Hataways character always talks about how hard it is to be a women in the business world.
People don't take you or your job too seriously.
They also think that women can't run a business.
This is something that is very important for me.
I always try to break that stereotype and do something that I love whilst not letting my gender define me.
It's hard at times but I get by.
I love that De Niro's characters doesn't care about gender as well.
He always cares about the personally.
If the person has the passion or not and if they are good at what they do.
"Sometimes, the things that Hathaway's character does have some consequences and can make others insecure which is why she has a great partner in the senior intern."
He advices her on the personal life while she helps in the business and technology life.
"In the end, I enjoyed it."
Flawless.
"Witty, romantic, and uplifting.. Just as you'd expect any Nancy Meyers movie to be."
I LOVED this film!
"DeNiro was awesome, Hathaway was great, the story line was believable & fun, & there were some awesome comedic moments."
"It took an unexpected dramatic turn in the last third, but that was played with relative subtlety, & also well done."
Highly recommend.
"Nice story, fun movie, very enjoyable."
"A feel good, very entertaining film."
The chemistry between Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway alone make this film worth the watch.
Russelling Reviews: The Intern - A enjoyable and unexpected 'coming-of-age-again' film Is getting old a bad thing or can it be a blessing?
http://russellingreveiws.blogspot.com.au/2015/09/the-intern-enjoyable-and-unexpected.html
pleasant film.
charming.
Hilarious and heart-warming.
Nice break from the big budget blockbusters but no less entertaining.
"When I first saw the trailer for this one, was not quite interested, because of the way it was presented."
"But now, I am blown away by the brilliant chemistry which Hathaway and De Niro have together in their roles here!"
Rob is the very charming and engaging kind of dude which I would love to become later on down the road.
"Ann I didn't like at first, but I sympathize with her with everything that goes on in her hectic life as the film went on!"
"Almost everyone was charming, even if a few people felt a little off at times, and the ending could have been more satisfying."
"Still, a decent drama/comedy, mostly aimed at married and dating couples!"
A cute movie with a great mix of humor & heart.
DeNiro as the feminist worked on many levels.
Great cast with some familiar faces and newbies.
I watched this movie tonight at the pre screening in Dallas.
It was so much better than I thought it would be.
It's a feel good movie and hilarious at times.
good and funny really injoyable
"Excellent film, warms your heart and is well done by Nancy Meyers!"
"A super comedy with heart, laughter and soul!"
sho buz
"This was a very good movie, different storyline than what's expected, about a young hype business owner who's successful but not sure what she needs in the next phase of her life and then gets a intern that's observant and wise through enough to offer advise but in an indirect way , made me cry√∞~,√∞~¬¢√∞~¬≠√¢~¬∫√Ø¬∏?√∞~"
So sweet and cute but in a genuine way not cheesy.
One of those movies that reminds us what's important in life.
purely an excellent feel good movie A+ actors putting on A+ performances keeping you laughing and a good feeling in your gut
The cutest movie I've seen in a long time.
"Something anyone could enjoy, no matter their age."
Simply adorable.
"Fun, entertaining, heartfelt; very enjoyable movie, with refreshingly real and multidimensional characters."
I saw The Intern in avant-premiere at the Ostend Movie Festival in Belgium.
Anne Hathaway is a successful entrepreneur of an e-commerce fashion shop.
Her husband takes care of housekeeping and their child and only gets to see her tired late at night.
Meanwhile De Niro gets hired as a senior trainee at Hathaway's company and offers moral support when Hathaways husband is having an affair.
"Although The Intern offers a few good laughs and both De Niro and Hathaway give good acting performances, this is not the good tragic comedy drama it could have been."
The Intern resigns to a simple moral tale: in the movie the husband is the 'bad guy' for having an affair and Hathaway the hero.
"Fact is in real life, both are victims of a very competitive society which means in order to be very successful, it often means one needs to neglect one's family."
"The Intern tries to be feministic, but in fact Hathaway in order to run her company neglects her husband and child (something men have often been accused for in the last decades)."
"In stead of using this situation to discuss the impact of having a demanding career on family life, The Intern ends up being a simple good-bad tale."
Never the less The Intern offers nice and easy accessible entertainment in typical Hollywood fashion.
But it's depth is neglectable.
"Was at the Seattle sneak peak screening - its warm, its Smart, its FUNNY."
Another Nancy Myers triumph - Robert De Niro & Anne Hathaway are a comedy pairing for the ages.
"Finally a funny movie that doesn't insult your intelligence, you will want to see this opening weekend to enjoy the big crowd ambiance!"
"I thought this was a good movie, very enjoyable."
It was nice to sit through a movie that was heartwarming and funny and never hear vulgar profanity.
Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway were great and the young actress who plays her daughter is adorable.
"I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised."
"It's warm, funny, smart, and thoroughly entertaining."
The Intern is exactly what you would expect.
An enjoyable dramedy with very little substance.
I really enjoyed the performances of Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway.
They have really good chemistry together.
"If they weren't in this movie, I wouldn't have liked this movie as much."
The whole cast was very good in their respective roles.
The story was ok.
It wasn't anything special.
You knew exactly what was going to happen.
"Sometimes, though, it was a little too melodramatic."
The drama and comedy did balance out well.
"Overall, this is a lightweight film with two great leads."
This is a nice movie to check out.
"It isn't spectacular, but it still is a decent film."
Great sappy movie A must see if you like feel good movies
Panemorfi taineia me panemorfi istoria!
Olokliri i taineia o megali morfi tou Robert de niro!!!
Mporis na ton vlepeis oli mera einai katapliktikos!
Parola auta perimena ligo kalitero telo stin taineia.
Poiotiki komodia pou aksizi to kopo.
"The stop - and - go pacing of the film may be a turn off to some, but if you can get past that, it is well worth a look."
Strong acting and story telling are at work here.
Bought this when it came out before seeing it cause I knew I would enjoy it.
I actually love Nancy Meyers stories.
The Holiday is one of my favorites & I still watch It's Complicated all the time.
I find Nancy's writing simple & sweet.
Even find the situations easily relatable.
This story was no different.
Anne Hathaway was awesome in this & I found Robert DeNiro absolutely charming & the chemistry between them was perfect.
Their dialog was very entertaining.
"While the story has kind of the same elements as her other stories & people might think I rated this a little high, I just really enjoy these type of movies."
"Great acting, sweet story, funny moments & also heartfelt moments with some real life scenarios."
"If you liked The Holiday & It's Complicated, you'll enjoy this one :)"
"A ladies-friendly and gentle comedy, The Intern is a predictable, unrealistic and overly sentimental delivery which hugely, if not mostly, relies on the presence of its two leading characters."
"A so-so melodramatic, feministic story is told in a way which would neither annoy you, nor amaze you, but it would just work fine for a calm lazy evening with your beloved half during the cold winter."
Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) is a retired successful businessman who cannot simply enjoy the calm life of being a pensioner and decides to participate in a senior-intern program.
Soon gets assigned to be the assistant to a young founder (Anne Hathaway) of a super successful start-up in the field of online sales.
"Slowly, both of them have to learn how to work together, but also to learn to be different persons."
"Needless to say, the level of predictability, the lack of any climax in the story development and the completely unrealistic depiction of what the post-modern start-up corporate world is, damage the movie's chances to be taken seriously."
"Luckily for director Nancy Meyers, the presence of Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro and the formidable chemistry between them somehow saves the movie from being a complete flop and actually turns it into something passable."
"As a whole, The Intern could have been a much better movie, given the record of Nancy Meyers (Something's Gotta Give), but in the end the flaws in her overall approach towards the story is partially compensated by the actors and the feel good final feeling."
Watchable during a flight or in a cold winter evening with your better half next to you.
DeNiro ages with charm and wit.
Probably could have cut 15 min out on the Hathaway family life but Bob carries the day.
Saw a preview screening of this the other day.
"Absolutely fabulous, funny and sweet."
"It may not get the big box office bucks because most prefer action movies these days, but it's a fantastic movie."
De Niro still has it!!!!
Hilarious.
Wonderful treatment of intergenerational differences -- they are true and funny.
Anne Hathaway and Robert DeNiro are great in their roles -- very believable and a treat to the intellect -- not manufactured sophomoric humor.
Great lessons in this film for all generations.
"A very satisfying film, I will go again."
It's a sweet film.
"Amid the hijinks and coincidences there's emotional appeal of how some seniors can counsel, guide and astonish young people with wisdom and experience of the past."
"One can tell that the writer-director is a woman (Nancy Meyers) -- echoing, for instance, a tender bedroom scene from Sopfia Coppolo's 'Lost in Translation'."
"De Niro is superb, Hathaway too; and a the child actor steals her scenes and your heart."
Saw a preview on Wednesday and cannot wait to see it again on Friday.
"When you want a job done correctly, hire a pro---and I don't just mean in the movie."
The casting was the best part of the film for us.
Nice to see a movie made with great foresight when seeking a range of potential viewers.
My daughter is in her early 40's and I am 20 years older.
We both enjoyed the film which is a rare thing for us to experience (some studios choose to cater to only a small demographic of moviegoers).
We will definitely recommend The Intern to many others.
THE INTERN Review The Intern is a comedy that everyone can enjoy.
"It features refreshingly likeable characters, a charming story, and a lot of gut-busting humor."
"This movie is a story of a fish out of water story, of friendship, relationships, working in business, and the challenges and advantages that the classic ""age gap"" presents."
"Strangely, the movie feels like it would be a dime-a-dozen romantic comedy if the two characters were closer in age."
"But this is just one way that this film feels fresh as the plot, characters, and situations don't feel overly forced."
"There is a mix of old and new that works well here because, as we know, experience never gets old."
"In modern Brooklyn Robert De Niro stars as Ben Whitaker who, as a 70 year old widower, chooses in his retirement to work as an intern for Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) the multitasking founder of a growing internet clothing trying to have success in business and family life."
Over time they come to see each others value more.
Both of the leads are delightfully likable characters and you want them to reach their goals.
"Ben's chivalrous and experienced attitude makes him the epitome of the title ""oldie but goodie""."
Jules is a representation of the new age entrepreneurial business kickstarters who are admired today.
The differences between these two is never uncomfortable and keep the audience hoping to see more of what these two will accomplish.
All of the supporting cast are also interesting and play off of each other remarkably well.
"These include Rene Russo (Thor) as the flirtatious maseus, Nat Wolff (Paper Towns) as a manager, Adam Devine (Pitch Perfect) as an outgoing fellow intern who, like in all his other roles, needs to imporve his social skills, Zach Pearlman, Andrew Rannells as Jules' assistant, and Christina Scherer as Jules' secretary."
"After this, I really want to see Rannells and Scherer in more quality roles."
"The director, Nancy Meyers, scored a home run when casting this movie."
"Regardless of one's previous experience in business, it is easy to understand how all of these people relate and what the individual business struggles mean."
The entire narrative feels modern and is perfect for 2015.
"As a comedy, the part of the movie that should stand out and make people want to see it is the humor."
In the two hour run time the audience laughed out loud 125 times.
"The jokes cover all ranges of topics and are presented through the creative situations, snappy dialogue, and perfectly timed visuals."
But the movie is not simply another attempt to push as many jokes as possible into 2 hours.
"As cliche as it sounds, the movie has heart, lots of heart."
"Ben, Jules, and the others care for each other."
"We learn about Ben's 40+ years with his wife, his life as a retiree, Jule's struggling family life, the other interns' personal struggles, and more."
In some comedies I lose interest in the dramatic moments and am just waiting for another laugh.
But in 'The Intern' the comedy is equally captivating interesting as the more emotional sequences.
The technical aspects also cannot be overlooked.
The production design gave each location a unique and interesting look.
"Though his work is frequently such a perfect fit for the scene that it is unnoticed, Theodore Shapiro delivers a whimsical and delightful soundtrack for whatever the tone of the scene requires."
"After his most recent work, Shapiro is quickly becoming a respectably accomplished composer for comedy (he is possibly becoming the new Christophe Beck)."
There is very little to feel unsatisfied about with the film.
The change in tone is occassionally jarring and I was lost to a few of the jokes.
"But other than a few trite criticisms, almost any demographic will come away from this feel good movie smiling."
The Intern' was among my favorite comedies that I have seen in the recent past.
"Work place comedies have become so common that one of the most beloved sit com TV series of all time was simply called ""The Office""."
"But here the performances and situations feel fresh with the new twists of the aged intern, family struggles, and contrasting lives."
"It demonstrates the value of experience, management, passion, leadership, wit, and carrying a hankerchief (as well as blinking - ""Jules hates it when people don't blink"")."
"- A- Nancy Meyer comedy THE INTERN from Warner Bros. Pictures stars Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway, Rene Russo, Adam DeVine, Nat Wolff, Anders Holm, Andrew Rannells, Zach Pearlman, & Christina Scherer and is out in theaters September 25th, 2015."

I thought it was going to be good and it ended up being even better than i expected.
"Funny, entertaining movie."
Robert Di Nero does a great job in this role.
Good for date night or the family.
Thought it was a really great movie and sweet.
Not happy with the ending though... No 2nd chances!
A pleasant and enjoyable movie.
In being pleasant this movie can only be average.
Robert DeNiro should be ashamed of himself...
Heart-warming story with many funny plots in it.
Good movie to watch:)
"very emotional and funny movie, hoghly recommend"
"It's over produced and sugar coated, lots of women crying with alot of handkerchief handing out with a minimal amount of comedy."
Deniro makes his usual amount of facial expressions.
Delightfully thought provoking!
Recommended watch.
A lovable main cast.
"The movie contains some very strong/emotional moments, but is also filled with come empty moments."
"Yet, it's a feel-good movie."
Just finished watching the screener and I have to say it was a funny movie.
You would not be disappointed in going to the theater to watch it.
My wife said it was sweet and very cute :)
"The definition of a nice, happy film."
"It hit all of the emotional dramedy notes, but ultimately, it is forgettable."
"I will say, though, it is the first Adam Devine role where I didn't want to punch him in the face."
Kudos for that.
"I really don't feel that I was the core audience, however."
My mom said I was being too cynical.
She gave it 4 stars.
I want a grandpa.
Love it
"""The Intern"" is a timely reminder that each generation is valuable to other generations."
"Funny, smart and relevant, ""The Intern"" is a gentle nudge telling us not only can we work together, we also have more in common than we thought."
Robert De Niro gives a spot-on performance that reminds us why he's one our best actors.
"Anne Hathaway is appropriately quirky, professional and devastated as life takes unexpected turns."
Looked forward to this movie and don't regret watching it.
"Brilliant movie, funny and touching in places with what Jules had to face in her life.."
I shed a little tear and was pleased with the ending.
The soundtrack sounds pleasant to the ear of which I need to find.
a must have DVD on the shelf.
"The car , Audi Q7 was nice.."
Robert De Niro rarely disappoints and doesn't here.
"But the film - perhaps unwittingly - reveals the ways in which driven businesswomen poison their relationships with spouse, parents, and children, yet nevertheless maintains that Hathaway's character is a victim of sexual stereotyping."
It doesn't wash.
"If you kept the same script, but reversed the husband/wife roles feminists would be frothing at the mouth."
"As it is, you just end up feeling sorry for the husband, the ""rising star in marketing"" who gave it all up to be a right-thinking progressive house-husband."
"There was no reason why the career woman here - she WAS President of her own company, after all - couldn't have taken her tot to her touchy-feely office after pre-school and no reason why her husband had to sacrifice his own dreams."
Good grief!
What century are they living in!
"Wonderful, Feel Good Movie!"
Best movie I have seen in awhile.
Not your typical love story of a couple but between two unlikely people separated by years of age.
It was fun loving and taught you that age is just a number.
You can find friendship anywhere.
"B When walking into the Intern you should know that this movie won't get oscar buzz, but instead just know that's it's such a fun movie."
"The Intern follows this senior citizen that becomes an intern with his boss that's younger than him and as the film goes instead of creating a sappy and akward lover story, we get a brighly developed friendship between Anne Hathaway and Robert de Niro that makes this film funner than sappier."
"Again, this is jusf like any Nancy Meyers feel good comedy but what makes this film such a good and enjoyable one is Robert de Neio once again giving such a great performance that his character is so likeable that he is clearly the one that saves this movie."
"Also Anne Hathaway was good but not great because in the begginjng she starts out being rude and a cartoony character but as the film goes on, you start to like her because you understand why she acts like that and how well developed her chemistry with Robert de Niro gets."
Problems with this movie are that there are many sub-plots like Anne Hathaway with her family that you don't care about and other sub-plots that are completed and are pointless to the main story of this movie.
Also that the story's structure starts to lose it's focus with it going on different kinds of directions.
Lot's of funny jokes are in this film but also bad ones that keep on going and just make this movie akward.
"Also that the conclusion to The Intern starts to drag on when you start to wonder when the film is ever gonna end because it adds so much more content for the sake of making this film longer and just like any feel good comedy, In the end besides those flaws, The Intern won't give you anything new but it's the perfect family movie that will make everyone laugh, think about the film's morals and get entertained by."
"Nothing in The Intern is absolutely terrible, it's just a movie that you should go watch with a family and just have fun with it for what it is."
Rating: 76% and a B
"Clever, witty and backed by a formidable cast, The Intern, however, is bogged down by cheap plot twists and a forgettable ending."
A outstanding performance by Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro.
The Intern its a Masterpiece.
It delivers so many emotions and comedy that the movie feels unique; even though this theme has being used before.
Surprisingly entertaining
"Una historia que bien podr√≠a decir ""sacada de la vida real"" (por ella)... pero contada de forma ligera, c√≥mica y tierna."
"Sure this won't change the movie business or uplift De Niro or Hathaway's careers, but The Intern is a thoroughly entertaining comedy-drama from Nancy Meyers that was fun from beginning to end"
"This movie is heartwarming, comical, and endearing and the acting is good."
I thoroughly enjoyed it.
beautiful movie.
I love it
"Great movie, funny parts and a."
Cute story
3 out of 5 stars.
Nancy Meyers' films have a certain formula.
"Take a good setup idea, add some of the best star actors and have lots of top technical work like Art Direction, Set Decoration, Costume Design and Cinematography."
"By the 2nd Act, start adding the usual rom-com mechanics, schmaltzy music and a heavy dose of sentiment."
"By the 3rd Act, throw in some unnecessary slapstick and side stories that go on too long."
"End the film with everyone happy, a few more tears while characters learn life lessons, and close with lots of hugging."
"This has been the pattern with ""What Women Want (Mel Gibson, Helen Hunt),"" Something's Gotta Give (Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson),"" ""It's Complicated (Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin),"" and now ""The Intern (Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway)."""
"Not an awful way to spend two hours, just a very predictable one."
"In this case, the film is worth seeing for Robert De Niro, who has evolved into the genial senior actor of his generation with ""Meet The Parents,"" ""Analyze This,"" and especially ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" which is the best film of his late comic period."
His subtle work and skill with all the other cast remind you of how great an actor he has been for over 40 years.
Really enjoyable - will want to see it again when it comes out on Dvd for a date night in.
Warm movie.
The chemistry between DeNiro and Hathaway is pretty amazing.
Perfect for cuddling on the couch with your friends or significant other.
loved this movie.
"laughed a lot, but the ending was a little abrupt."
My favourite Nancy Meyers so far.
Both leads work beautifully off of each other'.
Movie with.
Characters you don't see much in movies.
A successful woman who isn't a bitch and and old man who isn't grumpy and chasing his lost youth.
Refreshing and fun
It was cute And fluffy
"Robert de Niro and Anne Hathaway have wonderful chemistry, and there were many hilarious moments as well as heartfelt ones."
"It delivers wonderful acting, and mood which you can feel when your watching it."
"Despite the fact that some parts have issues that can't be fixed during screenplay which makes it ""Slightly Bad""."
Caught half of it on the plane.
"It was ok, with all the feel-good clich√©s one would expect."
"Though its execution is a little formulaic and predictable, its premise leads to some interesting and timely dialogue, the overall tone is very sweet and charming, and the chemistry between the leads is wonderful."
"Sure, it's light and fluffy."
"It relies on the chemistry of its leads instead of an engaging plot, and I didn't mind."
"I laughed, I teared up, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie."
"The fact the film isn't edgy, gritty, or overly dramatic shouldn't be a detriment when talking about a comedy."
"It's a film about life, love, and friendship that left me feeling happy."
The supporting cast of his fellow interns are fantastic.
I was pleasantly surprised by this film.
What a beautiful story.
"I cried, I laughed, I cheered."
Two characters that I was definitely rooting for.
"Cheers to the film writers for highlighting the beauty that is wisdom, and the struggles that so many older people experience, that is ageism."
A nice light hearted film.
Descent acting and easy to relate to especially if you've recently lost a parent and are watching the other parent navigate new terrain.
Got a little slow in the middle but I liked the story.
Intelligently written.
Witty.
"Great cast of characters you can identify with, and become invested in."
Funniest parts were the generational-gap situations...which makes it enjoyable for all ages.
Can't wait to watch it again.
"May be it is not a film with enough relevance to transcend far from the simplicity of its message, but the good feelings of such an endearing story stays with the viewer enough to consider it a ""movie with heart"", just made to be enjoyed."
Surprisingly good - quite a well-written and well-acted dramady that was anchored by Robert Deniro; came out of it thinking I may start looking for a senior citizen intern to bring into the world of new-age technology marketing... A great date movie if you are looking for something like that!
This is not my typical kind of film.
"I usually stay away from a RomCom, however being a recruiter, I was intrigued by the idea of seniors in a start up."
"I went in with very little in the way of expectations, but was pleasantly surprised."
"We were the youngest people in a packed theater, and the older crowd seemed to really connect with Deniro's character."
"I thought this was a creative idea, the pace was great and the right mix of humor and sensitivity."
This was a feel good movie.
It made me laugh and cry while keeping my attention without all the fast paced action that I like.
My only complaint was the way it ended but even that wasn't bad.
"A very refreshing feel good comedy, about the change in generations and the clear difference between them, all thanks to the great performance and charisma of De Niro, and the hilarious script."
Took the family and we all loved it
Very good inside look at a older retired ceo who decides not to sit on the sidelines in his prime.
Nero plays it perfect with his knowledge of experiences of life and passes it onto the younger generation.
FUNNY.
I enjoyed seeing a movie that addresses real life situations and the portrayal that we can let our walls down and trust one another.
"De Niro, Hathaway and Russo were great."
Both De Niro and Hathaway were brilliant!
Surprised by Russo's appearance too!
A nice feel good movie :)
This movie was very good & Robert DeNiro played a great role for this movie & the ending was very good to where Ann Hathaway played her role also very well.
The comedy made it a great date movie.
Laughed out loud more than once - all the good scenes are NOT in the movie trailers.
A good light feel good movie
an enjoyable comedy.
"Won't win any award nominations, but it is an entertaining story with a good cast of characters."
Such a cute and fun movie!
I took my dad to see it for his 65th birthday and we both really enjoyed it.
"We'd both recommended it for someone who wants to watch a lighthearted, good feeling type film."
Wonderful synergy between Hathaway and DeNiro - chemistry with Rene Russo not bad either
"Fun, light-hearted and enriching film."
Left me feeling good and less old!
This film looks promising!
"This movie was good, but the way it just abruptly ended was horrible!!"
"PREVIEW: This is probably going to suck, if De Niro's recent comedies are any indication."
The trailer also smells of formula.
REVIEW: This one definitely surprised me.
"It wasn't without its cliches, but it was a cute and rewarding film that I thoroughly enjoyed."
The intern shines because of a great cast and I treating concept that is executed just right
I was looking forward to watching The Intern but unfortunately this was a little average to me.
Robert Deniro was cute in this but the story fell flat and not a lot happened.
Warm and loving √∞'-√∞'√∞'-
I totally enjoyed this.
Very well done and funny.
Good acting by all.
This was really good!
except for her staying with her cheating ass of a husband...
"Great chemistry between DeNiro and Hathaway, gorgeous sets, some fun humor but simplistic and disappointing ending."
I expected better from Nancy Meyers.
Got boring fast!
Really crappy ending was stupid really.
Another home run for Nancy Myers.
This film is so good it should be seen by a lot more people.
Anne Hathaway and Robert deniro have great chemistry together and you would not expect that.
8/27/2016: This movie was much better than I expected it to be.
The cast was amazing and the story was very good.
Loved the movie just hated the ending
"Sometimes you just need a movie like this... light, fun, and all the actors gel well together!"
"It was cute, funny, thoughtful, simple, heart-warning, and insightful-if a bit creepy at times."
De Niro and Hathaway were great together.
"The Intern is that sentimental comedy drama film that tries to have that heartwarming, feel good outlook as the characters are going through some career challenges."
"When it comes to these types of films, they can be predictable."
"Very predictable, that when watching these characters going through some struggles with their career and their personal lives."
It is easily foreshadowed that everything will be okay in the end.
"The film starts with a 70 year old widower Ben (Robert De Niro), who is always trying to keep himself busy in retirement."
"He applies to a senior intern at an online fashion company, who the CEO is Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway)."
"Jules is an every day busy businesswoman, she is always focused on her work, and tidy when it comes to planning, and having everything done the way she wants it too."
Jules is also trying to maintain her personal life with her daughter and husband Matt.
"Her husband takes on the role of a stay home daddy, taking the daughter and participating in all the events with her at school."
"Ben assist Jules in her every day work by driving her around, giving advice, and life experience lessons, and also trying to help her out with her daughter."
When Jules is coming across a breaking point of wanting another CEO to take charge of her company that she started.
"Jules struggles can be predictable, and the film easily shows that every challenge she is going through will easily be handled."
"Ben is like that magical person that shows up, does the entire handy errand work to keep everyone on track."
Sort of like a Mary Poppins ideal person.
Jules personal life that she rarely has with her husband and daughter does open the room that her marriage is not exactly healthy.
"When her husband is having an affair, as Jules is almost non existent."
"Jules is under pressure, the challenges are not really much of a struggle when solutions were easily given."
Making the ending of her accomplishment with deciding the fate of her career and personal life less awarding than it should.
Anne Hathaway and Rober De Niro were both charming and decent with their performances.
Surprisingly funny with not too much cheese
I enjoyed it very much.
One of the better movies I have seen in a while
funny and entertaining.
Deniro is great and Anne Hathaway is good
"really enjoyed this film, funny, charming and entertaining"
"Strictly a paint-by-the-numbers feel good don't think too hard vehicle for lovely Ann Hathaway and stalwart DeNiro in a celebration of all things Brooklyn, it's mostly do the right thing generational piffle as senior citizen intern turned Big Daddy DeNiro gently mentors Hathaway into being more conscious and mindful in all respects as she builds her fashion empire."
What is Rene Russo doing in this?
".....it's also an extravaganza of product placement galore mainly for Apple Computer, fancy linens and jazzed-up bathtubs, escalades, a little token tai-chi thrown in, as you feast on the row houses and brownstones of Park Slope, you can buy those too...."
"Completely pleasant from beginning to end, there's nothing in The Intern that'll challenge or provoke you...but you know what?"
That's okay: too few movies these days mistake 'somber' with 'satisfying' and director Nancy Myers-of Something's Gotta Give and It's Complicated fame-is someone who gets that.
"Frankly, we could use more filmmakers like her."
Thought it'd be funnier but overall it was good.
Great Movie.
Robert De Niro And Anne Hathaway Are Amazing As Always.
My heart feels warm after watching this
"Fresca, divertida, amistosa."
Claro que la volveria a ver.
Buena interaccion: De Niro y Hathaway
Robert De Niro is Ben Whittaker a retired widower who at 70 decides to follow up on an advertisement for a company seeking senior interns.
He arrives amid a tornado that is the companies founder/owner Jules Ostin (Ann Hathaway) and as her personal assistant they both build a close relationship.
Its quite funny and entertaining and has to be De Niro's best performance in quite some time
Some smiles but pretentious and pandering.
Very good movie!
It was very creative and original!
A must see
"Pleasantly surprised with this movie, it's better than I expected it to be."
"De Niro and Hathaway have great chemistry, they're quite charming."
"Other than some unnecessary segments and supporting cast, 'The Intern' is fine."
"As expected, this was a pleasant movie."
"I enjoy pleasant things, so I enjoyed the movie."
"Without spoilers, it's difficult to give a full review."
I will say I appreciated the way they handled the marriage in the movie.
It's rare to see a more nuanced relationship.
Great film.
De Niro is classy.
Ending was bleh and stopped it from being 5/5!
Better than I had expected but De Niro was definitely a weak link.
You could tell he was phoning in on what turned out to be a pretty pleasant overall film in spite of his performance.
Could also stand to lose 30 minutes of so.
Smiled all the way through it.
"Meaning, relevant, heart felt & fun."
This is connecting with your character Robert De Niro shows a humble side trusting business man as A new age woman takes on a roll Ann Hathaway is seamless in character a gentle giant in business this story shares the hardship to succeed and what's important is The unexpected friends people make
There's not much to say about The Intern.
It's predictable and funny but there's something big missing from it and I can't put my finger on it.
A light hearted movie.
The type I've not seen in a long while.
Loved everything about this movie.
I recommend it & am looking forward to owning it.
Well acted & humorous.
A pleasant little movie with a couple of nice performances from De Niro and Hathaway but beyond that not much else.
Maybe the movie is a little too nice and I was left feeling very unsatisfied by time the credits rolled.
A tv movie.
Robert de Niro is god
This was a very cute movie.
For the most part it was up beat as well as pretty true to fact when running your own business.
The chemistry between Di Nero & Hathaway was perfect- it just clicked!
warm and good and well done.
Very fresh very nice
This is such a sweet movie.
"Gotta love good, light-hearted quality entertainment."
Certainly a nice change of pace from much of what Hollywood gives us.
Thanks Nancy Meyers for once again giving us a lovely picture to enjoy.
Great movie until the ending.
Very disappointing.
A feel good film that made me like Robert Deniro after years of disliking mostly everything that he has been in.
Loved this film and the chemistry between Deniro and Hathaway was amazing!
It worked so well and was funny and exactly what a dull day needed!
Finally a good movie to go and see
Good movie makes you happy but sometimes cliche.
Totally enjoyable.
"Yeah, I don't care what you think..."
Great movie with De Niro + Hathaway.
A little schmaltzy but whatever.
Liked the whole Senior intern premise.
Very entertaining + recommended for sure!
Enjoyable move for the over 35 crowd.
I also like a story with a truly strong feminine lead.
"Finally, Hathaway and Deniro are gold."
Very cute!
Love DeNiro & Hathaway
Few questionable moments and cliches.
But pleasant enough to watch.
precious.
cute.
awwww.
ROBERT DE NIRO.
A nice film.
Perhaps 20 minutes too long.
"Entertaining, funny & great casting!"
"Good family film, great story, DeNiro was amazing"
Such a great bff movie love it
The Intern enjoyed the Story.
You can't always get what you want.
I enjoyed the costumes and was glad it ended in a happy ending Loved how different everyone was.
The story was very universal and a family film for everyone because it speaks for everyone.
Or speaks to specific generations.
This did not focus on one generation or another or a male vs a female audience but was a good film for a universal audience.
Everyone can get something out of this story.
I like how this film starts in the middle of a story and ends in the middle and can continue right where it was left off.
I liked how Anne Hathaway eventually made it back up with his husband.
I liked how the costumes of the characters all clearly were different from each other and were used to identify who the character was.
And this film mentions that how the characters dressed meant something about the age and era a person comes from.
This film has comedy as well as mention specific and go cover serious issues.
I liked how this film covers real life relations issues between colleagues between loved ones no matter their age and where people stand.
This film has heart and investment in characters through character development.
I liked it when the male co-workers did an inside job to brake in to delete a message email to Anne Hathaway's moms computer.
That was just hilarious.
It is a film I would but because It speaks to different ages based upon their ages.
One age group are sex is going to get something different that another age would not.
Not Great.
"Overall the movie captures what modern society acts like, they hit the nail on the head for all of those points."
"However, the movie was waaaaay too....plastic feeling for me, it honestly looked like a big commercial for Apple...Uber...Netflix and a few other companies thrown into for good measure, but Apple hit the head hard in this one, and I didnt quite like it."
"Other than that I enjoyed myself with the plot and characters, but the movie did seem to be cut off in the end, which disappointed me a bit."
"Overall, good movie, would see again."
Cast was great.
Story was fun.
Great development.
A very fresh and independent comedy.
It shows elderly people know a lot more than what young adults think and can be very helpful.
"Robert De Niro surprisingly delivers a charismatic performance I have never seen before, but it does suit him and he should do more roles like this."
I really enjoyed this.
"It had some great laugh out loud moments, and Anne Hathaway and Robert DiNero were fantastic (as expected)."
"Some reviewers were right in saying he could've been utilized a little more, but a very enjoyable film."
This movie was beyond beautiful√¢¬¶ It shows you how the older generation and the younger generation if they just take the time he can come together and make something beautiful by just listening to one another
"""Robert De Niro is back in his comfort zone in this pleasant comedy from Nancy Meyers"" Movie Review: The Intern Date Viewed: September 30 2015 Written and Directed By Nancy Meyers (What Women Want, The Holiday, It's Complicated and Something's Gotta Give) Starring: Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway, Rene Russo, Anders Holm, Andrew Rannells, Adam DeVine, Zack Pearlman, Jason Orley, JoJo Kushner, Nat Wolff, Steve Vinovich, Linda Lavin, Celia Weston and Molly Bernard."
"Writer and director Nancy Meyers is like a cute little poodle, even though the dog performs the same tricks, she still loves her owner."
Meyers' movies have become comfort food for female audiences.
"After making ""What Women Want"", ""Something's Gotta Give"" and ""It's Complicated"", Meyers is back with another female-centric comedy."
"""The Intern"" is a gentle and funny work-place comedy that works mostly because of the likable chemistry between Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway."
"Meyers has finally put Bobby back in his comfort zone after making so many terrible movies (The Big Wedding, Grudge Match, Little Fockers, Last Vegas and The Bag Man)."
"Robert De Niro plays Ben Whittaker, a widower and retired executive who decides to get back in the working game because nothing much happens in his life anymore."
"Even though he is in his 70s, Ben Whittaker decides to become an intern at a fast-growing online fashion company."
"Ben is assigned to work with founder and CEO Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), who is at first skeptical about him due to his age."
"Eventually, Jules comes to like Ben and she let's him become her chauffeur."
"Likeable and reliable, everybody in the work place likes Ben and he gets attracted to Fiona (Rene Russo) who is the in-house massage therapist."
"Jules is married to her stay-at-home husband, Matt (Anders Holm) and has a little daughter named Paige (JoJo Kushner)."
"When Ben is assigned to drive Paige to a kids' birthday, he discovers Matt kissing another woman."
It all indicates that Matt can't hold on to his marriage because Jules is absent all the time due to her being CEO.
"""The Intern"" is a pleasant and charming comedy from Nancy Meyers."
"De Niro and Hathaway have great chemistry together and ""The Intern"" doesn't have the sitcom feel I saw from the commercials."
"It is not great cinema but ""The Intern"" was sweet enough for me to recommend it."
This movie is ridiculous.
C-
One of the best movie of the year.would tell everyone to see the movie
Displays real issues but in a fun and sweet way.
It isn't about the issues but they are very clear.
This movie is a heartfelt expression of how the world may change but people don't.
"People will always be people, confusing complicated and wonderful."
Such a great movie.
Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro are such a cute pair and work well together.
A touching film for the modern sensibility- a feel-good and well-acted movie.
Fun take on older folks in the workplace.
One of the sweetest movies I've seen in a long time.
"DiNero and Hathaway are fantastic in this feel-good, sappy story."
Definitely worth seeing.
The intern was an average comedy but it wasn't quite as good as I'd hoped for it to be.
It was easy to sit through it but it was just as easy to forget it afterwards.
"It's not thoroughly funny, but the rest of the time is relaxed, heart-warming relaxation hour; held aloft by 2 rock-solid leads."
You would think Robert De Niro would show more emotional range though.
Deniro still got the charm.
My review https://42lifeinbetween.wordpress.com/2015/09/27/the-intern-review/
Almost flawless entertainment!
Super cute movie with some great advice for the working woman.
"It had kind of a weird, abrupt ending but good besides that."
Such a nice story and the acting is top notch.
"I was really rooting for this movie going in because I enjoyed Nancy Meyers' previous films Something's Gotta Give and It's Complicated, but this movie has some issues."
"The first hour of this movie is a mess and worthy of a 2 star review with its cringeworthy ""old people are so outdated when it comes to the younger generation's lingo and work process"" jokes that just do not land at all."
I may have smiled twice in that first hour.
"DeNiro is giving it his all and though some of the dialogue is not good, he does a decent job delivering them."
Hathaway is fine too but also is given a really messy timeline of work ethic that doesn't mesh all together.
"The ensemble is filled with great people like Adam Devine, Andrew Rannells, Rene Russo, and a hilarious but small part from Linda Lavin."
Anders Holm who I like didn't really fit his part well and I think they under utilized Rannells and Russo.
The movie starts to get better in the second hour after DeNiro and Hathaway form a bond and work pattern together and have some really touching scenes.
"Overall, the first half of this movie needed some serious rewriting because it was as if Nancy Meyers was a 100 year old out of touch woman that just based the young characters off of stereotypes in other movies and it needed to be cut down because it got to its point but never decided to leave it."
We get it.
DeNiro is lonely so he's happy to do any work he can do around the office and Hathaway doesn't want his help.
You don't need to spend an hour trying to explain that to the audience.
"The ending is a little abrupt and cleaned things up too fast but it was fine, nothing terrible."
It's a good rental
A nice little movie with a great chemistry between Hathaway and De Niro.
Slow movie.
"Good message, but too long and some plot points were not wrap up."
"Really well balanced film, though Hathaway and De Niro are borderline annoying at points."
"Loved, loved, loved it!"
"Great acting, sweet story."
Uplna spokojnost.
Takto ma podla mna vyzerat komedia.
V dnesnej dobe uz rarita.
"Ben: I still have music in me, absolutely positive about that!"
"The intern tiene a Jules (Anne Hathaway) como la CEO de un negocio de internet que de la noche a la ma√±ana se volvi√≥ exitoso, y deciden crear un programa para que personas de tercera edad puedan trabajar como internos dentro de la compa√±ia."
"Ben (Robert De Niro) es viudo, y sin mucho que hacer en sus d√≠as, env√≠a un video para ser considerado, y es escogido como pasante."
"Lo inesperado es que a la final Ben sorprende a todos y logra no solo mejorar el negocio, sino le da una lecci√≥n valiosa a Jules."
Nancy Meyers la directora es especialista en estas comedias que te hacen sentir bien.
"Tienden a ser un poco idealistas, pero no hay duda que son entretenidas y siempre tiene personajes encantadores."
"La historia de hecho me sorprendi√≥ sobretodo en el primer acto, porque me encontr√© enfocada en Ben, queriendo verlo triunfar, y desde el principio es infalible."
Todos lo quieren y esta ah√≠ para ense√±ar lecciones sabias.
"El problema es que cuando la pel√≠cula sigue avanzando, nunca vemos un lado mas vulnerables o con fallas de Ben, entonces termina siendo perfecto, algo que no existe."
"En contraste, Jules quien al parecer lo tiene todo bajo control, es toda una ilusi√≥n, ya que al tener este negocio exitoso, no tiene el tiempo para estar con su familia y ser una madre y esposa atenta."
"Pero estas fallas la hacen alguien con quien puedes relacionarte.La historia de infidelidad me pareci√≥ que estaba de m√°s, porque no tenia ninguna relevancia y no le agrego nada a la historia."
"The Intern es mas de lo que aparenta, pero no sabe bien como balancear el drama y la comedia."
"Se les paso un poco la mano en el tercer acto, ya que parece una pel√≠cula completamente distinta de la de la primera media hora, donde es un placer ver la relaci√≥n que tiene Ben con los otros pasantes que son d√©cadas mas j√≥venes que √©l y tiene un tono ligero."
"Igualmente es una de esas pel√≠culas que disfrutas, pero que no te vas a acordar de ella al d√≠a siguiente."
Good but overly simplistic and optimistic.
Deniro is possibly the greatest actor ever
"A welcome change of pace as of late for acting titan Robert De Niro, as well as just a charming little movie from the woman who practically invented charming little comedy-dramas as we know them, Nancy Meyers."
Absolutely love this film!!
Nancy Meyers still makes such a great film with messages that need to be heard.
This film reflect so much on how society is now days and Robert De Niro was such a gentlemen!
Love him!
and the chemistry between both actors was fantastic!
Truly fantastic film!
A chick flick told only the way Meyers can.
Thoroughly enjoyed nonetheless.
Hathaway & DeNiro lit up the movie screen.
"This was a sweet,√Ç¬†enjoyable,and very cute movie."
"I would like to say it was a romantic comedy, but it wasn't.√Ç¬†It wasn't a comedy."
I'd say it was a sweet business-type family movie.
"At first, I thought it was exactly likeThe Devil Wears Prada√Ç¬†and Hathaway was the mean boss and DeNiro was the intern."
But Hathaway's role was not rude and abrupt like that of Streep.
"Instead, at times the looked like father and daughter as the film progressed."
Those two worked extremely well together in the film.
They have the on-screen magic!
That is for sure!
"There are so many funny scenes in the movie that I cannot narrow them down to the Top 3, but my all time favorite one was when Rene Russo entered and ""introduced"" her hands to DeNiro's body."
Lmao!
"Talk about hands-on, if you get my drift."
"There was a twist in the film- but a good twist and NOT a bad one; it was so sweet that the√Ç¬†entire√Ç¬†audience said, ""Awwwww."""
It was too cute what the audience said.√Ç¬†DeNiro really captured and connected with the√Ç¬†audience in this film.
People including me were√Ç¬†talking√Ç¬†to him as if he was right there with us in the√Ç¬†theater; people were clapping for him in certain scenes; it was just a very high√Ç¬†entertaining√Ç¬†and sweet film.
Anne Hathaway was astounding!
Rene√Ç¬†Russo was dynamite!
The opening of the film with a special lady who was after Ben (DeNiro) was absolutely√Ç¬†hilarious!√Ç¬†This is one of those movies where all you need is the popcorn and the sweet sounds of your laughter because the entire cast√Ç¬†delivers√Ç¬†that to you!
I am laughing thinking about all the things I am√Ç¬†recalling√Ç¬†from seeing√Ç¬†the film!
You will NOT be disappointed!
Everyone brings it and scores!
A little predictable.
But a drama with some good comedy
lovefilm great promise of keeping your life going even when you're on your older generation and reconnecting with younger generation
The feel good new business model old people and working females can lead full lives film of the year goes to.
"Defintely escapist and ideal and doesnt show a lot of the bumps along the way, but the film strictly succeeds on another Hollywood trope being the likability of the leads in this case the gentlemenly senior in Robert Deniro and the eager if wound up Anne Hathaway who both deliver above the bar performances and dimension to the roles they were given."
Probably will rank along side or at least close to Devil Wears Prada where the polish and the acting brings up a film and is escapist enough to check realism at the door and you ride along on the journey which works for this one.
"Surprisingly enjoyable,."
"This heartfelt movie feature 2 genuine, heartfelt performances from Deniro and Hathaway."
They both are believable in their roles.
You tell they bought into this movie.
"Hathaway is the owner/creator of a new business, and Deniro is a widow who takes a internship at the company as part of a senior intern program."
"The movie puts old school values against new age values and the results are fun Deniros characters is an extremely calm, nice, non controversial man who cares about others well beings."
He also teaches the youngsters about values and other things from his past.
This relationship is very cool too see.
"The movie isn't deep in plot, but it does explore things life family, overworking, and challenging the norm."
I enjoyed the film for the on screen relationships which were truly fantastic.
"Sweet, sensitive, thoughtful movie - so much better than I expected A retired 70-year-old widower, Ben (played by Robert De Niro), is bored with retired life."
"Good work too by Anne Hathaway, who is very convincing as the go- getting entrepreneur."

"Irresistible first half, clunky second half Love comedy/drama when done right, have liked some of Nancy Meyers' previous work, Robert De Niro at his best is one of the best actors of the latter half of the century (evidenced in 'Taxi Driver', 'Godfather Part II' and 'Raging Bull') and Anne Hathaway has also given good performances."
So 'The Intern' seemed promising.
"The Intern' didn't quite live up to expectations, it could have done more with its timely premise and does have things resolved too easily (the cheating subplot in a nausea-inducing forgiveness/reconsideration speech) and characters written too neatly and cleanly (with Ben being very amiable and irresistibly likable if too perfect, Jules is the only one with any real arc)."
"At its best though, it is easy to warm to and for the first half it was continual engagement that didn't demand too much but did what it said on the tin."
What makes 'The Intern' work is the two leads and their chemistry together.
"De Niro is just a joy in one of his best performances in recent years, while Hathaway is a charming high-flyer with good comic timing, succeeding in allowing character growth to a potentially problematic character."
"Their chemistry, for such an unorthodox pairing, is so natural and grows warmer without doing it too quickly."
Rene Russo is good value though her role is not large while the performances of the colleagues are amusing.
The only weak performance with a very flimsily developed and bland character comes from Anders Holm.
"It looks good, it's slickly shot and edited and the locations and Hathaway's wardrobe are beautiful on the eyes."
The direction is mostly controlled and the film goes at a sprightly pace in the first half.
"The irresistible charm and a script filled with pleasantly amusing lines and small scenes (such as De Niro turning up at the office in a suit, with a calculator and addressing himself, in a way that's very business-like, in the mirror that reminds one fondly of 'Taxi Driver') and wry observations and insight, taking care in making characters as amiable as possible while never fully developing most of them."
The story may lack depth and be unsurprising with some dramatic short cuts in the second half but mostly engages and is charmingly frothy and lively.
"Sadly, things take a downturn in a jarring tonal shift to a clunky second half though thanks to De Niro and Hathaway it's not unwatchable."
"Really admired what 'The Intern' did in giving Jules an arc and it was interesting to begin with, apart from benefitting from more show and less tell at how good she was at her job and such, but halfway through became awkwardly indecisive."
"The sprightly, feel-good and very easy to warm to tone of the first half is replaced in the second half by pacing that tends to sag and things taking too much of a melodramatic and schmaltzy tone."
For instance the heart to heart/forgiveness scene could have been heartfelt but makes one feel nauseous instead.
The wry insights remain but the more sporadic comedic elements don't feel as well timed or placed.
"As said, Anders Holm doesn't have the same enthusiasm as the rest of the cast and gets lost amidst everything else which does hurt Jules' character arc when she has such a dullard of a spouse."
"The music score is nothing that sticks in the mind, for music that's pretty repetitive this was a problem."
"Overall, decent enough film if one of two halves, starting off very well but later mostly goes down south."
6/10 Bethany Cox.
"DeNiro Charms the Entire Cast Totally bored with life, Robert DeNiro's character seeks out a new career."
"He had worked out, traveled the world, read books, on and on."
"While he is relatively happy, he feels empty."
He is seventy years old when he reads a flyer on a bulletin board.
"A rising company is looking for ""senior"" interns, that is, people who have had tons of experience who can be used as a kind of publicity stunt."
Ann Hathaway is the wunderkind of a clothing company that has feasted on the Internet.
"DeNiro finds himself with no power, attached to Miss Hathaway, but doing no work."
"Eventually, by taking on some of the hard work and showing utter kindness, he manages to become quite the institution in the firm."
His boss is trying to balance both her career and her marriage (and daughter).
"At some point, it is decided that she should hire a CEO and give power over to him/her."
"Soon DeNiro finds himself at the beck and call of Hathaway, becoming part of the family."
"This is a touching, but predictable effort."
It's still a nice two hours and DeNiro steals every scene he is in.

nice pairing Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) is a 70 year old Brooklyn widower and a retired executive from the phone company.
His son's family lives out of town.
He tries to fill his days of leisure.
He spots a flyer advertising internships for senior citizens.
It's a fast-paced fashion internet commerce site run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway).
It's been a hectic 18 months for the married mother of little girl and she is reluctantly forced to use Ben as her assistant.
Her husband Matt gave up his job to be the stay-at-home dad.
Fiona (Rene Russo) is the company masseuse.
Ben befriends everyone until Fiona starts to find him indispensable.
Nancy Meyers gets a bad rap as the rom-com has become a passe genre.
This is not a rom-com but it is a friend-com.
De Niro is a little too perfect as the magical old guy with all the answers and lessons for the young ones.
This movie is a bit too neat and clean with the characters.
Hathaway is the driven multi-tasking internet executive.
The characters may be stock but the actors make them breathe.
Some of the side characters have some fun.
The big twist (not that surprising) does not really raise the drama although Nancy is trying to say somethings.
It all combines to create a nice pairing of these two great actors.
Surprisingly Intern-resting!

"De Niro and Hathaway's chemistry is a sheer delight, but Nancy Meyers' distracted screenplay in the second hour undercuts an otherwise genuinely entertaining start As far as on screen pairings go, 'The Intern' boasts probably one of the most interesting ones in recent memory."
"On one hand is Robert De Niro's 70-year-old Ben Whittaker, presently struggling to deal with the concept of retirement; on the other is Anne Hathaway's 32-year-old Jules Ostin, the founder and CEO of a tremendously successful fashion-based e-commerce company called 'About the Fit' or 'ATF' for short' who is presently struggling to deal with the demands of her investors while not neglecting her six-year-old daughter and stay- home husband."
"Diametrically opposite as they may be, writer/ director Nancy Meyers wants to prove that these two individuals can have much more to learn from each other than you and I can imagine."
"So through a community outreach programme which one of her company's executives hatched, Ben finds his away into ATF as a senior intern after impressing some of the much younger employees with his warm sense of humour, his cheery can-do demeanour and proving least likely among his competition to drop dead while on the job (yes, we mean this literally)."
"Despite Jules' initial chagrin, that same executive assigns Ben directly to Jules in order to set an example for the rest of the employees in the company."
"And as the trailers would have you know, Ben will slowly but surely overcome her reservations with a keen sensitive eye and an unerring professionalism, eventually becoming not just a calming ear amidst the day to day chaos at the workplace but also an invaluable source of advice for her professional and personal woes."
"Just so you know, De Niro and Hathaway do not eventually fall in love with each other, so you can rest easy if you're wondering or worried if things would eventually get weird or awkward between them; and to put that at rest, Meyers finds De Niro a romantic interest in Rene Russo's in-house massage therapist Fiona and occupies Hathaway with the discovery that her husband (Anders Holm) has been cheating on her with the stay-home mother of her daughter's schoolmate."
"It is also in the latter where De Niro will come most prominently to play counsellor and confidante, nudging her not to blame her workaholic tendencies for her husband's infidelity."
"Oh yes, there is a message of empowerment and encouragement for all career mothers within ‚Äì and a slap on the face if you will have it for their other halves who use that as an excuse to commit adultery."
"In keeping with her recent movies, Meyers has eschewed male- dominated Hollywood stereotype by fashioning Jules as a strong, opinionated and successful female individual who can be a hands-on CEO to over 220 employees at her company while being a dedicated mother and loving wife."
"Her response to her husband's infidelity isn't to fall in love with a fellow co-worker or to divorce him immediately; rather, she wants to give him a second chance, believing that a re-affirmation of their mutual love for each other will convince him to end his affair once and for all."
"You may disagree ‚Äì as Ben does ‚Äì with whether she is being na√Øve, but hey it's undeniably still a strong gutsy move for a woman to put aside her pride and her hurt to offer forgiveness and to choose to stay together."
"Meyers also has yet another intention here, and that is to quash ageism at the workplace."
"It isn't just coincidence that the company Ben joins is in the Internet business; as incongruous as his presence may be in an industry that arguably does not appeal to his age demographic, Meyers wants to let the young upstart CEOs of today's tech companies know that ‚Äì as the tagline goes ‚Äì experience never gets old and that there is something that the Gen-Y leaders can learn from their Gen-X counterparts."
"You can almost hear Meyers' own lament through Jules that the men of today are a far cry from the likes of Jack Nicholson and Harrison Ford, and that just as Jules does, we will find something to learn from the silver-haired members of our workforce."
"Both are equally poignant lessons, but perhaps not so wieldy in the same movie."
"Meyers tries to convey the latter first, and does so quite persuasively through a mixture of situational comedy and punchlines that are gently amusing but never by way of caricature ‚Äì indeed, the closest she comes to farce is an 'Oceans' Eleven' like 'heist' led by Ben to break into Jules' mother's house and delete an email that Jules had accidentally sent to her mother."
"The first hour of the movie cruises by like a breeze, in large part as well thanks to De Niro's spot-on comic timing that he hasn't lost since the last sequel of 'Meet the Parents'."
"There is also much delight to be had watching De Niro and Hathaway break the ice between their respective characters, their dynamic sincere, heartfelt and genuinely affable."
"Unfortunately, Meyers doesn't quite do the former as well, and the latter half of the movie sags as a result of a more melodramatic change in tone and pace."
"Not to trivialise women in similar predicaments, but it isn't quite so convincing just why Jules' husband would cheat on her in the first place and a tad too convenient how Ben comes to chance upon the fact which ends up putting him in a moral quandary."
"And though Meyers' screenplay could do with some work, it is the sheer effervescent chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway that keeps the movie afloat."
"Both are equally lovely in their respective roles, and the strength of their performances is enough to make you forgive the fact that their characters are probably too good-natured to be true."
"Yes, 'The Intern' works best when it is a two-hander between its unlikely on screen pairing, and fizzles out especially in the last third once it decides to make three a crowd."
Great concept!
It's amazing how well this film captured the essence of being a millennial brand.
"The craziness, and hectic behind- the-scenes life of the online startups that we see pop in our Instagram feed daily."
I actually love Anne Hathaway in this business woman roll.
"Also the movie will make you like Robert De Niro, as he plays a kind gentlemanly retiree."
I never get to see De Niro in this type of roll (due to me usually not liking any movie he's in) but he's so admirable in this movie and I couldn't imagine anyone playing it better.
I love how the movie shows some of the struggles and prejudice a female founder/CEO can face without portraying Anne's character as whiny or completely incapable of running her own company.

"Good premise, flawed execution The Intern is what I call a ""paint by the numbers"" film."
"It hits all the necessary notes for this sort of comedy but misses the point of what a movie is supposed to be, like a paint by the numbers painting misses the point of art."
"It's like a robot has got the premise, seen a lot of comedy/drama-ish feel good films like Driving Miss Daisy, Devil Wears Prada, etc, and decided to spit out a screenplay."
"It doesn't work, and what does work, is sustained by the actors performances."
The main problem with the film is the lack of structure.
"The main protagonist is Ben, at least, that's what the audience is supposed to be led to believe."
"His life starts the film, he is the one that leads the audience to the situation, but he has no flaws."
He has no dilemma.
He has absolutely no character arc.
"He is a widower with too much free time and sort of has a void to be filled, I guess?"
"He doesn't seem to be suffering, and all of his problems are solved at the first 5 minutes."
Done.
What is his change after that?
Nothing.
"He is a perfect gentleman who does not learn anything in particular, does not grow, has no epiphany or real change."
"He is a mentor figure, he is not a protagonist."
"Jules is the protagonist, but I guess the director did not know that fact."
"She sort of has a character arc, but it goes by so awkwardly it's just confusing."
"She has problems with her marriage, which are sort of represented by her husband sleeping when she wants to have sex."
"She seems to have trouble managing the company, but characters SAY she is having trouble, we don't see it."
"We have no sense of urgency, no crisis, characters SAY she has trouble managing it all."
"First rule of film media is: SHOW, don't tell."
"Then there's the whole husband cheating subplot that was sort of created to add tension and drama, but falls so flat it's unbelievable."
"First, the audience learns about the cheating first, and then the protagonist states she already knows about it."
"Well thanks for letting us know, you gave us NO indication that was a problem."
"Second, it is resolved as a Deus Ex Machina, he just begs for her forgiveness and for some weird reason, she's just OK with it."
I don't buy it.
"Then there are the annoying minor characters that have almost no development, and the most annoying writing decision in the film: adding a scene where they break into the mother's home to delete an e-mail, JUST for the sake of adding a frantic, fast paced highly comical scene where one was needed."
It goes absolutely against character!
Ben offered to break into the house?
What?
WHY?
"He was supposed to be a down to earth, calm, wise man who would know better that Jules talking to her mother and explaining her feelings would be better than doing an illegal break in a mother's home."
"Rene Russo's character is a waste, added for two reasons: clich√©d, juvenile comedy (oh, he is aroused by that older woman, how hilarious!"
"oh, the fat guy interrupted that massage and could NOT get out of the room silently, so funny!"
"), and to just make the audience accept Ben was seeing someone else and would not, under any circumstances, fall for Anne Hathaway's character (so the hotel room scene is not as awkward as it must he felt while writing it)."
"Characters just do the most bizarre things just for the sake of hitting the points the movie wants to hit, and it goes absolutely nowhere."
Does Ben get the CEO job he so OBVIOUSLY deserved?
He just does Tai Chi and that's it.
There is no turn to a second or third act.
"The whole thing is muddled, confusing, paced so awkwardly you'd assume there is a real plot cut from the movie."
"Maybe it was a murder mystery, I don't know."
The whole thing is lacking a proper movie structure.
"Now, the only reason this deserves a 5/10 and not a 1/10, is the acting chops of Anne Hathaway and Robert DeNiro, who does NOT fake in an acting job as he has done for the past years."
"He keeps it consistent, keeps it believable, hits the tone and sells of that character."
"I mean, imagine Bill Murray in that same role."
"It would not work, because we would not see past the actor when the character is so low-key."
"DeNiro can do it because he is one of the best, he knows how to pull it off, and he does."
I am saddened by the lost potential.
"I really like the premise, someone older getting into a modern workplace, learning and teaching."
"If we got this movie's screenplay and asked for, let's say, Lawrence Kasdan to do one additional rewrite, it would be an instant classic."
Oh well.
Better luck next time.
Such a heart-warming movie!
I can't even with this film!
"Such a family, beautiful plot, the actors are so good & the whole mood of the movie is just gold!"
"An obvious 10/10, love these kinds of films!"

Nice Story that's a bit predictable.
"OK, first and foremost, I'm sick of the pretentious a-holes who rush like sharks to a seal feeding area to condemn this type of movie."
You blow hards go and make a few movies and THEN spout off your know it all garbage.
GAWDALMIGHTY!
"OK, with that out of my system, this movie is a fairly predictable and pedestrian film."
"I have to be brutally honest however, a couple of small curve balls did surprise me, but overall, eh."
"Not a great movie but hey, a nice story."
"I use that word a lot, 'nice' and I've acknowledged that before."
"For some films, it's the best description."
"It's not exciting, it's not thought provoking and it's not intended to be."
"It's entertaining and at times, a bit uplifting."
"In a word, it's NICE!"
What the hell is wrong with nice?
Not a damn thing.
"The whiney folks who feel every movie must have impact or teach a lesson or...what-have-you, are jerks, morons and probably failed film students who were rejected by EVERY movie studio, even the Troma Team."
"Let's be honest you egomaniacs, shall we?"
I'm just a guy who loves movies and in this movie I see a pleasant story that allowed me to sit for an hour and 1/2 and just enjoy a nice story.
Is that so wrong?
"No, dammit, it isn't."
"Am I angry, yeah, I guess I am."
Do I care if I offend a few douche bags?
Hell no.
"Sorry, I'm really ranting here."
"Bottom line, Robert De Niro can do ANYTHING (and sure, it seems like lately he WILL DO ANYTHING!)"
and he pulled off this role very nicely.
"If you don't like this word, stop reading....NOW!"
He's a mild mannered good guy who wants to not be bored.
Anne Hathaway has shown she can handle acting very well.
"I keep wanting to see more depth in her characters, but this movie didn't require much and that's fine."
"She's a good actor, not a shlub who gets by solely on looks."
Rene Russo.
Nuff said.
"The supporting cast do a magnificent job doing exactly what they are supposed to do, SUPPORT."
"Sure, I found some things that I scratched my head at."
Where did HE go?
Why did SHE do this?
What ever happened to....?
"But it's not a documentary, it's a nice (YEAH, NICE-IN YOUR FACE!)"
story that shouldn't have to explain everything.
People don't go to the movies to have every detail correct and every single moment or event fit perfectly into reality.
"Take it from me, I can be a stickler with some types of movies, but I'm also a realist and even when I'M the one whining, I try to keep my whining in perspective."
Some here do not.
They think they're some important critic who's word will make or break a movie.
NONE OF US HERE ARE VERY IMPORTANT!
GET OVER YOURSELVES!
"So, bottom line, it's a nice (yeah, nice) movie that entertains."
"If you like simple movies that simply make you smile, this is one for you."
"If you demand perfection, make your own damned movies."
"The Intern: Exceeded my expectations So I had no interest in The Intern, at all."
The only reason I ended up watching it was because I was cooking in the Caribbean and needed a time out in a beautifully air conditioned room.
"Now I like Hathaway, I think she's a competent actress but I very very rarely get to see her in anything as she is a very niche actress and only tends to do the kind of movies I go out of my way to avoid."
With her and DeNiro I expected at least strong performances and I got them and a lot more on top.
"The ludicrous plot plays out better than you'd expect, it turns into something beautiful and heartfelt."
The Intern is undeniably a sweet movie and it has substance but sadly it also has a number of overwhelming flaws.
"Now Nancy Meyers is arguably the ""Chick flick"" queen and therefore I haven't seen many of her films."
Based on this despite it being a competent little film I don't think I'll be rushing to see anymore.
Though full of emotional and thought provoking moments it simply has too much that plays against it and a finale that I had to see with my own eyes to believe.
"Passable, but I'm not the demographic."
"The Good:

Heartfelt

Well made

The Bad:

Questionable finale

Plenty of schmultz

Things I Learnt From This Movie:

I will never understand why so many react like that to infidelity, leave immediatly you silly girls!"
"The Intern is a cute, even likable story about how elders may know more then you think It seems that in todays working world, the intern is the new entry-level job."
"Even with the great recession almost over, the millennial generation faces a new world of hard debt and technological competition."
"They also face a high number of equally qualified candidates that are more then willing to work for wage, and even for nothing, for the hope that they may receive an offer for a better job within the company their working for."
My second job was also an intern position that paid nothing in exchange for experience.
"I didn't stay with the company, but I learned a lot about working in the Hollywood industry and even in an office environment."
Why are a lot of people willing to work for free?
"Perhaps with the way the economy is recovering, more companies cannot offer as many paying jobs, yet most people are still intrigued by having a particular business on their resume, with another thing to boast about."
"Who wouldn't want something like Amazon, Apple, or Google within their credentials?"
Tech businesses are the rage and everyone seems to be trying their hardest to get in just so they could say they were in.
"The Intern boasts it's own account of a trainee who may be a few years older, but just as able bodied and ambitious as the next guy."
Former phone book executive Ben Whittaker (played by Robert De Niro) has traveled the world and spent his retirement trying to relax and enjoy new hobbies like Tai Chi.
"Yet now that he is widower, he still feels empty."
"Rather then sulk, he takes a new kind of intern program that recruits seniors."
His impressive resume and video resume lands him a job for a growing e-commerce fashion company that's in the same building that Ben had worked in for many years.
"His boss is the positive, but still intimidating Jules Ostin (played by Anne Hathaway) who find that Ben has been assigned to her."
"At first, she assumes that he is too old to contribute a whole lot and give him easy work."
Only when her chauffeur becomes drunk and Ben takes over that Jules starts to warm up.
Ben engages further with her business and even with her family.
Jules in informed by her board that she should find someone else to act as C.E.O.
for her company to make the business more professional as it had grown in such a fast eighteen months.
Ben does his best to help Jules while she contemplates her decision.
"On the surface, The Intern sounds like the kind of movie that would be easy to cater to older audiences with it's wholly positive attitude."
"For the most it is, but part of me enjoyed it a lot more then I thought I would."
A lot of that has to do with Robert De Niro who still puts a lot into his role.
"It may be no Taxi Driver or Cape Fear, but he still seems to be saying a lot with how to relaxed the millennial generation has become."
"Story wise, The Intern is nothing of a challenge; it's your nice story about the misunderstanding of someone's skills while making a friend."
I'm still on board as the movie's tone relies on the nice chemistry that De Niro and Hathaway share.
I'm really glad they don't attempt any hint of romance and keep them as friends.
"A racy art house movie might have taken on that notion, but director Nancy Meyers knew what her audience wanted."
"In short format, The Intern is a cute movie."
"It's likable and while not a hilarious movie, did manage to get a few laughs out of me."
I'll give this six and a half e-commerce sites out of ten.
The Intern shouldn't have trouble finding an audience.
It's charm should win most people over and maybe De Niro's points may get through to any young people watching.
The Intern is The Boss!
"Robert De Niro, as a retired 70 year old who re-enters the work force and proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that oldies are still goodies_x0085_.also proves just why he is a star as he shines so bright in this movie as to be blinding."
He is perfection.
"There are some actors that the older they get, the better they get, and De Niro is most certainly one."
"Anne Hathaway, as the genius behind a too-fast growing company is playing what I consider one of her best roles yet."
And Rene Russo is still gorgeous as ever.
"I was impressed, also, by Anders Holm who played Hathaway's husband."
"But then, actually, I was impressed with everyone in this movie."
"There really wasn't a single thing or character I would change in this one, and that's saying something."
"The casting, the plot, the dialogue_x0085_and fancy this, it was a funny, touching, enjoyable picture with NO foul language, NO overly-suggestive crude garbage that usually just makes the audience cringe."
"It was well written, well -acted, and well presented."
All rare these days where just the writing ability seems to have dwindled into the dirt.
This one is evidence that there are still writers and creators who have talent out there.
More movie producers should make a point of seeking and finding them!
This is a fun movie that you are going to be recommending to everyone within reading or hearing distance.
One of the best films we've seen in some time and left us all smiling as we left the building.
"That kind of movie that makes your day This is my first review on the IMDb website and i have been a member for more that 9 years now, that's who much i loved this movie."
It just give you that positive thoughts and energy within a lovely comedian scenario.
I loved how they mix between the classic culture with the modern one.
It was very interesting to watch how they remind our generation about the habits which they are missing from the classic one.
De Niro and Anne Hathaway have excellent work chemistry.
Director and camera teams made a great job too...
"Team work, thank you for this lovely movie...

A 2 hour long commercial The Intern is a perfect example of the soulless crap Hollywood dares to crank out.
De Niro plays a retired 70 year old who is bored to death and therefore seeks to work for free as an intern for a booming e-commerce company run by Ann Hathaway.
The film feels like one big fat commercial (and it actually is).
"At this hipster e-com company everyone works on Macs, Ann drives an Audi, she lives in a residential hipster house."
"She drinks Stella Artois beer (they make sure you see the label), brand names are also dropped (lego, Netflix), other products are also clearly visible; Starbucks, Sony, Skype, Samsung,.."
Even the music sounds like music from a commercial (not joking!).
Al these 'people' in the movie are the examples of successful hipsters and the 'problems' they have are just first world problems.
"I also could not stand the characters: all these conflict avoiding, apologetic, overly helpful nitwits."
"If you see De Niro playing this cardboard character (it's written that way, he tries his best with it) it's hard to believe this was the guy who played in Taxi Driver."
The Intern is also so Politically Correct it's sickening.
You can feel being manipulated while watching this garbage.
It felt like these subliminal messages in They Live.
"People should not have paid to see this, they should have been paid to spend 2 hours being pounded by this extensive commercial marinated in a forced 'feel good' message."
One big clich√©.
Did anyone involved in making this movie really believe that this movie is good?
This movie is so shallow that it makes a puddle look like an ocean.
The idea of mixing a pompously acting Robert De Niro with a hysterically acting Anne Hathaway is an example of how not generate on-screen chemistry.
Not that the acting is bad.
It's the story.
It's one ongoing clich√©.
"It is a combination of dull, boring, and contrived."
"It's Father Knows Best meets I Love Lucy, except in this case the characters take themselves seriously."
"This movie manages to take several important social themes and reduce them to pulp, and even worse, reduce the principal characters to clich√©s."
A bored older retiree with nothing but time and a manic young business woman.
C'mon!
Not exactly the cutting edge of literary originality.
"And what is worse, they are not funny characters."
"The supporting cast is funny, but they are not the principal players."
Now the story has potential.
The movie actually starts strongly.
The De Niro character is introduced and his issues clearly presented.
"Then the movie tanks, and tanks quickly."
A promising start leads to a contrived story and muddled finale.
This movie reaffirms the old movie maxim - never judge a movie by its coming attractions.
"""The Intern"" entertains like a seasoned professional."
"Sometimes it's good enough to be an audience member who can just sit back, relax and enjoy the show_x0085_ and smile."
"After 40 years in the business of printing telephone books and then losing his beloved wife of 42 years, he did his best to adjust to his new life, and it worked ‚Äì for a while."
"He applies, via a terrific self-made video (the company's requirement), and sits through a series of amusing interviews with company employees young enough to be his grandchildren_x0085_ and he gets the internship."
"It turns out that, at this stage of the game, Jules needs Ben's wisdom and support more than she'd be willing to admit ‚Äì to him or herself."
Jules is simply a modern woman who's very likable and subtly inspiring.
"Pretty funny, great story all can relate to no matter your age or sex."
NOT a romance.
I caught an advance screening of this last night.
"The theater was close to being packed with men, woman and children."
The movie was surprisingly quite funny; didn't know anything about it before viewing.
The entire theater ended up cracking up numerous times.
"There were various times I felt bad for De Niro's character, but he was optimistic and didn't let it effect him, so it was great."
There were a couple of instances I would have never guessed things about the movie.
There is one scenario in the story that is tough; what would you do if put in that circumstance.
I believe ages 20-80 can relate to this movie.
We had De Niro's aspect as well as Hathaway's.
Good storyline.
"The ""Intern"" group of guys were funny too."
I'd see this again.

vacuous You have to imagine Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway have their pick of projects.
They must have piles of scripts sent to them.
And this is the one they choose to spend their time on?
The only intrigue this film offers is pondering the 'why' of that question.
"An IT start up takes on senior citizen interns because... well, the reasons are never quite explained."
"The older guys mock 'tweets,' and not tucking your shirt in."
The younger guys mock a lack of tech savvy.
Among all this gentle (i.e.
"not funny) humour about generation gaps, a bawdy joke about an inappropriate erection appears."
Then some bizarre break in and escape from the cops.
"Meanwhile, a successful woman will inevitably be betrayed by the man in her life, the narrative tells us."
"Trite, unreformed storyline with one-dimensional characters: what did this A-list cast see in the script?"
Does Nancy Meyers have incriminating negatives in a vault somewhere?
Modern-day Hollywood genre filmmaking at its most putrid.
Cuddly and Feel-Good with some Laughs Greetings again from the darkness.
A feel-good mainstream movie featuring two big time movie stars will likely have box office success and cause a lot of people to laugh out loud.
"In other words, the latest from writer/director Nancy Meyers should be celebrated for its entertainment value, rather than picked apart by film critics."
"OK, I'll give it a try."
"Robert DeNiro stars as Ben Whittaker, a retired 70 year old widower, who just can't seem to find meaning in hobbies and the leisure life."
"He applies and is selected for the ""Senior Intern"" program at About the Fit, a fast-growing online clothing company run by its founder Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway)."
"In addition to being a Type A driven and obsessed with details company leader (the type that rides her bike through the office to save time), Jules also has a husband, a young daughter and a fabulous brownstone."
"What she doesn't have is enough sleep, any friends, or enough time to enjoy any of the good stuff."
It's quite all right if a buddy flick with DeNiro and Hathaway seems unusual to you.
"At the same time Ben arrives on the scene, Jules is struggling with her investors' decision to hire a more experienced CEO so that the company can maintain its phenomenal growth."
That's about as deep as the business talk ever gets (but just try to keep track of all the Apple product placements).
"Jules initially spurns Ben, but of course, he soon becomes invaluable around the office, and while blinking his eyes, becomes her most valued confidant and adviser."
Much of the comedy is derived from Ben's interactions with the young employees.
"It's quite simply a 'generation gap comedy' that makes all the points it needs to make without really breaking a sweat: senior citizens are a wealth of knowledge and can bring value to an organization or relationship, young people can learn from elders (it's OK to shave everyday and dress for success) _x0085_ and vice versa (computers are our friend), there still exists some animosity between stay at home moms and working moms, stay at home dads face challenges of their own, running a company is hard work both physically and mentally, communication often requires more than a text or email, and staying true to one's self is not always easy."
"Ms. Meyers has brought us other mainstream films such as It's Complicated (2009) and Something's Gotta Give (2003), and she has a feel for presenting the upper-middle class as a punchline for the masses."
"She likes showing successful people in uncomfortable situations _x0085_ leaning heavy on awkward, while avoiding dangerous altogether."
"Her latest is a feel good movie that makes you laugh, without causing you to think about anything in your life that might bring you down."
And there is real value in that.
"OK, I tried, but there are some things that must be pointed out."
There was so much of Ms. Meyers' script that was begging to be pushed to the edge and analyzed from a societal aspect.
"Her specialty is rounding off the corners so that no one gets hurt, and because of that the film is bereft of conflict _x0085_ the single most important element for a meaningful scene."
"For example, the conflict between Jules and her husband occurs in a hotel room, which would be fine except _x0085_ only one of them is there!"
"Also, we never really get any of the story from Ben's perspective."
"Instead, we are just to believe that his Gandhi-like influence on co-workers is the only reward he seeks."
I also found myself bothered a bit in the quick glimpse we get into Ben's personal life.
"He blows off the advances of Linda Lavin and pursues Rene Russo _x0085_ understandable, but a bit off-putting given that this female writer chose to have him hook up with the 11 years younger character, rather than the one closer to his own age."
"There are many other similar type issues that warrant discussion, but that's why it's best to just sit back and enjoy this one, rather than asking ""what if?"""
2 hrs for a 45 min story!
And that's no lie!
Two hours for a thin veil of a flick.
Two hours and when it is all over all you have is a sore butt!
The first one and one half hours could have been cut to just thirty minutes.
"Here's what happens - Jules, a young beautiful girl (Anne Hathaway) with a stay-at-home husband and a preschool child, has created a more than successful internet clothes shopping website."
This is the opening of the story!
While she's out of town and through a slight miscommunication a 'hire the seniors' program is advertised.
"In walks Ben (De Niro) a 70 year old retired widower, and guess what happens, he is hired as the bosses (Hathaway) intern assistant."
"She doesn't like him, then she tolerates him, then she likes him."
"What a thoughtful, charming, helpful old man he is."
Then at the one hour and thirty minute point into the story something happens!
"The final thirty minutes are taken up with her tears, Ben being the understanding grandfatherly advice type, and Jules husband making an ass of himself."
"All is resolved, happy ending, and 'you' the viewer will say ""Thank Gawd it's over""!"
My final word.
In the character development of Jules it's pointed out in a big business article that she does something on a bicycle in the office.
How many times do you see her do this?
"I counted once, then never again does she do it."
So why was it put into the story?
"A Good, Clean, Wholesome Entertainment Sometimes you go to the theater, and you cringe at some of the previews, most of which are full of sex, violence, and an apocalyptic view of the world."
"It's hard to find a movie that is respectable and clean, with charm and wit, one that is suitable for thinking adults."
"""The Intern"" is such a movie."
Robert DeNiro is superb.
"How a guy who played such ruthless characters in ""Goodfellas"" and ""Taxi Driver"" can pull off this avuncular gentlemen is a testament to his craft."
"His Ben Whittaker almost seems too perfect, but DeNiro brings a humanity that makes him eminently believable."
"Anne Hathaway does a fine turn as the Internet entrepreneur, and fleshes out well what could have been a cartoon character of the √úbermom."
"The supporting cast supports wonderfully, giving the stars plenty of room to shine, not distracting from the story."
"And the plot never goes where it shouldn't, something that does happen in other, more cynical films."
So I would very highly recommend this film.
"It has some ""legs,"" as evidenced by the fairly sizable audience given that it's in its sixth week of release."
You know why?
You'll leave the theater entertained and uplifted.
And how often can you say that at the cinema these days?
Perfect feel-good flick Movies like this really show the range of De Niro & Hathaway.
"Sure it's not Taxi Driver, but this simple movie had my number from the beginning."
The whole cast is on point and charming.
The high tech start up backdrop keeps it current and the tender story threads never feel saccharin.
Two big thumbs up!

"A surprisingly nice movie... ""The Intern"" turned out to be a rather nice surprise of a movie, especially because it was a really good story, and it was helped along quite nicely with some impressive acting performances."
"The story told in ""The Intern"" is about elderly citizen Ben Whitaker (played by Robert De Niro), a widower who keeps himself busy as retirement proved to be not his thing."
And one day he signs up for an internship for the elderly at an online fashion company.
"What worked out in ""The Intern"" was the storyline and the absurdity of the situation."
It is a story that was quite original and funny.
But also the very impressive cast that they had gotten together for participating in the movie.
Robert De Niro really carried the movie quite nicely and Anne Hathaway also held her own quite nicely here.
"There was a great combination of comedy and storytelling in ""The Intern"", so writer and director Nancy Meyers really managed to create something memorable and unique here, proving her talent for telling an outstanding story with outstanding characters."
"""The Intern"" is one of the better Robert De Niro movies in a while, and if you are a fan of him then you should definitely check out ""The Intern"", if you haven't already done so."
I was more than genuinely entertained by this movie and it turned out to be a rather good and heartfelt movie.
"It is the kind of story that sinks in deep and Sticks with you for a long, long time."
"a delight through and through Robert De Niro is ""The Intern"" in this 2015 film starring Anne Hathaway, Rene Russo, and Anders Holm."
"De Niro plays a widower, Ben, who isn't satisfied with retirement and applies to be a senior intern in a successful Internet company, About the Fit, run by Jules Osnin (Hathaway), its founder."
The very busy and distracted Jules doesn't remember even sanctioning a program for senior citizens and doesn't want her new intern.
She has taken all the responsibilities of the firm on herself - it's her baby and she nurtures it.
"In the beginning, she has nothing for Ben to do."
"However, that changes when he becomes her driver, cleans off the junk pile desk that drives her crazy, and proves himself the most popular guy in the office."
"When she is faced with marital problems, guilt over having a stay at home husband and her long work hours, and thinks the answer might be hiring a CEO, Ben is there with support and sage advice."
"He's also there for the beautiful in-house masseuse, Fiona, who has taken a shine to him, and vice versa."
"This is a sweet story about what different generations can give to one another, as the kids in the office seek advice from Ben, and they teach him how to navigate the computer."
They see a man who wears a suit and carries a handkerchief but has amazing wisdom and business smarts.
"He teaches them about showing respect - in one scene, one of the workers has to deliver something to Jay Z, and Ben advises him to put on a different shirt and comb his hair."
"In one hilarious scene, Jules realizes she has sent the wrong email to her mother (one in which she refers to her mother as a terrorist), and Ben leads the reconnaissance mission to delete the email."
Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway are fantastic with great chemistry.
"Jules' daughter is played by JoJo Kushner, a gorgeous child."
"As Jules' husband, Anders Holm can show different feelings just by his facial expression."
"The company workers - Andrew Rannells, Adam Devine, Christine Scherer and others are terrific."
This isn't a film about culture clash so much as culture melding.
There is a Dutch nursing home that offers free rent to students to live there.
The result is wonderful.
How I wish there were more intergenerational programs like this.
The old are like fine wine - it's time to uncork them.
"A Female Fantasy Full of Faux-Insights and Hokey Hipness A Modern Feminist Fantasy where an e-Entrepreneur awash in New-Wealth and New-Problems that arise from, well, ""not enough hours in the day""."
"That Clich√© about the Problem of finding time to ""spend with the Family""."
"It used to be a Man's Challenge, but in this Postmodern World the Women are put to the task."
"Now there are ""Stay at Home Dads"", as We are Told They like to be called."
This Writer/Director Nancy Meyers Geezer-Gal is so Hip.
Or so She is want to try and demonstrate in every Scene.
"Robert De Niro is a 70 Year Old ""time on His hands"" Retiree who is just Giddy at the chance He is given to ""Play"" with the Youngsters and teach Them a thing or two about the loss of Chivalry (like carrying a hankie for the inevitable waterworks from the opposite sex)."
"The 'Machines"" addicted Moderns return the favor providing assistance on Laptops and Facebook."
"It's all so ""Today""."
"Anne Hathaway is the ""Boss"" and Founder of this Online Mega-Site that sells Pricey Fashions ""Guaranteed to Fit""."
It's made Her instantly Rich and without much Sleep and a Husband that is too Good to be True.
"This is all Mildly Entertaining and about as Deep as a Doodlebug, Charming at times and Insufferably Sappy at others."
Everyone and Everything is too Appealing and Almost Perfect to be anything more than Fantastical.
"The Movie is just too Pleasant and Wish-Fulfilling to contain any ""Real"" Insight or Inspiration except for, perhaps, Women with a ""Glass of Wine and a Laptop""."
"I saw the trailer for 'The Intern' sometime ago, advertised before 'Spy (2015)'."
"I liked the premise and the two lead actors, so today (the premiere in Romania) I had to watch it."
"I expected a fun, neat comedy but what I experienced was so much more: a great plot, brilliantly executed and acted."
"The jokes and fun parts were on point, and the world the movie created felt very authentic, immersive and a joy to watch on the big screen - this was helped by amazing costuming and cinematography."
"The entire cast had very strong chemistry between them, and both Hathaway and De Niro were wonderful."
"Overall an awesome, heartwarming movie."
I walked out of the movie theater with a smile.

Who doesn't love Bobby DeNiro?
"Wonderful contemporary story, great acting."
What more can one ask for?
"DeNiro totally inhabits the role of a bored NewYorker retiree who quietly, commandingly changes everyone around him for the better."
There were little bits of sentimental predictability but not many.
Nothing slowed the pace for long.
"It was lovely to see ageism front and center, blasted to smithereens!"
"Subtle, believable performances that did not pander to the problems of aging, but acknowledged them."
"The boys ""road trip"" was hilarious."
"The ""boys"" themselves were presented as stereotypes but managed to imbue them with personality."
There were some great laugh out loud moments!
"Nicely cast, well-written plot and characters."
Go see it!

What's Jules's big drama?
"That Cameron, her business partner (?"
"), thinks they need a ""CEO"" to help them run the place better?"
This information reduces this supposedly powerful woman to tears?
"Then... Robert DeNiro, ""Ben."""
"He sees a FLYER advertising for ""senior interns."""
"Does Nancy Meyers think that ""seniors"" have no experience with computers or the internet or smartphones?"
What an insult!
"Anyway, Bobby sees the ad, is ""selected,"" and shows up with veteran actress Celia Weston, some elderly black man and, INEXPLICABLY, Zack Pearlman, who clearly is NOT a ""senior."""
"These are the ""interns"" that are going to help out at Jules' business."
"The ""black senior"" was OBVIOUSLY thrown in to honor some SAG ""diversity clause."""
"He vanishes after his 2.5 seconds on the screen, never to be seen again."
"Then, the ""movie"" unfolds."
"Here are things that irritated me: Linda Lavin (from ""Alice"" ‚Äî as was Celia Weston) is desperate to connect with DeNiro, but is cruelly dismissed the instant Bobby meets ""Fiona"" (Rene Russo), the ""in-office masseuse""."
Rene INSTANTLY starts sliding her hands down Bobby's back_x0085_ all the way to his nether regions_x0085_ in plain view of everyone in the office.
Because_x0085_?
"Nancy must have thought this was hysterically funny, as she brings Rene back three more times, once in a scene where it looks like she's giving Bobby a blow job, when she accompanies him to a funeral (THEIR FIRST DATE), and once more at Bobby's apartment after they've apparently had the hottest night of their lives."
"Next: the scene where Anne shows her ""factory workers"" how to ""box up merchandise"" is enough to make me want to join the Black Panthers, and I'm white!"
"Anne stands, flanked by two white people, then two black people."
"Producers PURPOSELY put two white people next to Anne to make it look that they, too, were as stupid and dumb as apparently the black workers were, and that among FOUR PEOPLE, NONE of them knew how to fold a garment and put it in a box right."
"But Anne sure does, and that must be the reason she runs a big company!"
"And because Bobby (without Anne's knowledge) SEES her ""instructing"" the ""others,"" he therefore INSTINCTIVELY knows that ANNE is obviously the ONLY person on earth that should be CEO of her company."
Really???
Next: Why is it with all of Anne's great success and HUNDREDS of workers (all white; let's hear it for diversity!
"), that apparently her milquetoast husband is FORCED to stay home and take care of their precious brat?"
Why is it that they couldn't hire help?
"But, no, if they did that, they wouldn't have the next big trauma in Jules' life: Hubby is having an affair_x0085_ and he's found out by Bobby!"
Bobby_x0085_ who has never done a bad thing in his life.
"Who fell in love with one woman, married her, outlived her, and is doing nothing of value until he becomes Jules' slave boy, Paige's new BFF, and the Morality Police, making it his business to call Jules' hubby out on the carpet!"
When does this insanity end?
"Oh, and when Bobby drops by to give ""Matt"" (Anders Holm) a piece of his righteous mind, Matt has to tell him to ""watch out for all the Lego pieces"" everywhere."
"Since the man has NOTHING TO DO except DEDICATE himself to ""Paige"" and ""Jules"" ‚Äî why wouldn't he have the time to pick up the Lego pieces?"
Wouldn't he himself trip over them?
"Or_x0085_ does he leave them on the floor hoping that Jules will trip over them, stumble and fall into a coma, so he can carry on his ""affair"" with a woman whose face we never see?"
"Next: Are you going to tell me that Anne Hathaway is going to invite Robert DeNiro to come into her fancy hotel room and allow him to lie down on the bed with her, confess her deepest concerns about her husband having an affair, and then watch some old Gene Kelly movie on TV?"
Even Bobby knew that he was supposed to keep one foot on the floor.
This was so insane as to be laughable‚Äî not laughable_x0085_ cringe-inducing.
"Next: The pathetic scene of Matt trying to ""make up"" for his ""indiscretion"" and ""reconnect"" with Jules at the end."
BARF!
Nancy does a close-up of his hand_x0085_ no_x0085_ FINGERS_x0085_ reaching for Jules' fingers_x0085_ and Jules BARELY responds.
"Wow, what a triumph!"
"Jules and Matt are back together, everybody!"
Paige is going to have mommy and daddy and all her Lego toys and everybody's going to be okay!
What a barf-fest!
"All that said, I love Anne Hathaway and Bobby DeNiro AND Nancy Meyers can, ON OCCASION, do a comedic turn and do poignant moments."
"But overall, this film was an INSULT, especially to that poor black gentleman who was given a WALK-ON role to ""hint"" that, ""Yes!"
"We have diversity in our workplace!"""
‚Äî the audacity!
This film should be scrubbed from everyone's mind and hopefully we can all get on with our lives without continuing weekly therapy.
"Interminable This film was so sugar-coated, it should come with a dietary warning."
"Robert De Niro here is a recently widowed 70 year-old, bored with his life who applies for a senior internship post at an on-line fashion house run by its kindly, no make that saintly young founder Anne Hathaway who gets to cycle around her own office, as you do."
"Turns out old Bob worked in the same building for over 40 years and wouldn't you know it, immediately gets assigned to be her P.A."
"Naturally, she doesn't take to him at first, despite him making a hit with all the youngsters around him, sorting out their love-lives, accommodation problems, you name it, Bob'll fix it."
"Give him a day though and he's soon saving Hathaway's life when she accidentally sends an insulting e-mail to her mother, making friends with her young daughter, giving her informal advice on the future direction of her company and incidentally, sort out her failing marriage."
"Oh and along the way, he hooks up with a glamorous granny also on the company payroll, employed, I kid you not, as a permanent masseuse."
"I'm all for reducing age-discrimination in the workplace but really De Niro's character only lacks a pair of wings to make him today's equivalent of Clarence from ""It's A Wonderful Life""."
"Hathaway, too is just to be good to be true as the boss we'd all love to have, super- friendly, super-approachable and super-generous, hey Supergirl, she's after your cape."
"The narrative just rolled by with a succession of mundane but sickly TV sitcom situations which sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly but always resolve themselves positively."
De Niro mugs it up unashamedly while Hathaway gets to laugh and cry intermittently as is her wont.
The film could have been trimmed by half an hour and still seemed too long to me plus I hated the interminable light-hearted acoustic-based background music which is there in very scene.
"I just found this movie a real insult to the intelligence with its stereotypical characters, predictable situations and by-numbers acting."
And I say that as someone who is closer to De Niro's age than Hathaway's.
Forced life If I ran my own studio and this was brought to me as something we made there would be hell to pay.
A bunch of people would have to be off the lot by noon and whatever profits it made would go to finance a new Harmony Korine film as antidote to what we inflicted.
Why is that?
"It's a simple, feel good movie after all about an aging man, widower, who lacks a story in life and enters the upbeat world of a younger woman."
"They secured a lovely presence in Hathaway, DeNiro in his usual mode; two faces, sea otter smile or frown."
But it's such a cynical thing to take these people and reduce them in this way to make 'points'.
"It is feel good at the expense of all the other stuff, starting with laughs."
A story about an old man afraid he doesn't have anywhere to fit and he's reduced to nanny and chaperone and wise adviser of the young.
"DeNiro feels comfortable in the role or he wouldn't be here, as if he has agreed with himself actor-wise to be that person."
"A story about a career-driven woman and her stay-at-home husband who abandoned his own career to raise family; when after feeling neglected he turns to an affair, the only insights we have is that he cheated and she shouldn't compromise her career, no others are really allowed her character."
He is contrite by the end.
"We would be smacking our heads at all of this, at the old man stereotype if he was black."
We would be aghast to see a housewife reduced to this perception of her.
It dismays.
To see stereotypes we would like chased away from our storytelling come in through the backdoor as values?
"It's social tinkering with roles, a bit like that Trainwreck."
But indicative of the same tendency to reduce people as once plagued older films that we might would look back on their values as archaic.
"A revealing bit has three geeky twentysomethings lectured about men having been reduced to boys by a cultural shift as if this was a movie that was trying to see beyond reductions, but alas, restrained by how things really are."
Anemic.
Really Not That Bad!
"I just saw THE INTERN yesterday, and it really wasn't half bad."
"But the whole time I was watching Robert De Niro playing the sweet, kind intern, drying Anne Hathaway's tears and so on, I kept thinking about a movie he made many years ago called THE FAN."
"THE FAN was this great old-fashioned De Niro movie, the kind our hero used to make when he was really menacing and dangerous."
He plays this insane knife salesman who meets this young black baseball player who's a superstar but is having personal problems.
"And then De Niro decides he has to save this young superstar, but when it doesn't work out he goes berserk!"
The thing that struck me was that THE INTERN and THE FAN share an identical plot.
"And that while THE FAN tries to be dark and scary it's more often fall-down laughing funny, like when De Niro's character keeps bragging that he knows Mick Jagger and that they used to ""party till dawn"" together."
"Whereas THE INTERN is meant to be funny but is never fall down laughing funny, except maybe in one scene where De Niro leads a crew of young guys to break into Anne Hathaway's mother's house."
"(Really, it's much funnier than it sounds."
I swear I laughed out loud at some point!)
If only kind old Ben had flipped out at some point .
"like say, when he finds out his adorable boss' no good husband is cheating."
"I swear at that point I was waiting for De Niro to become his ""true"" self again, and make the snotty young husband pay and pay and pay."
He really should have gone all insane knife salesman on the guy.
"Or like in CAPE FEAR, he could have started bombarding the wayward husband with Bible verses and mumbling cryptic warnings like, ""you're gonna learn about loss."""
Now that's comedy!
Hooray!
for Nancy Meyers's generation.
They did know better... Nancy Meyers is nearly 70 years old and this script seems like an attempt to prove that her generation had the answers for pretty much anything.
Baby boomers everywhere united!
You are still needed to share the wisdom.
Next generations are only to show you how your laptop opens and how to create an account to facebook.
I guess there countless movies like this.
"You know some ""back in school"" flicks where the old guy or girl returns to ""school"" and instantly becomes one with the ""kids"" and gives life lessons to the youngsters, how to treat a girl, how to be punctual, about honesty and fidelity."
Next generations are just email-exchanging idiots.
Anyway.
"Despite the whole ""wisdom"" and ""life begins at 70"" crap, that are simply not true, you have 3 extremely capable and experienced actors (DeNiro, Hathaway, Russo) delivering the easygoing script and showing enough chemistry to make the film bearable."
There is obviously an uplifting mood (the self made millionaire girl etc.
etc.)
but there are troubles in Paradise.
You can't have it all.
Success and solid family and be happy.
"That's the message here, although in the movies anything could happen..."
"Atonal ... failed the 20 minute test Article Xii of the IMDb Guide for Top Reviewers admonishes us to ""move aggressively to correct misconceptions"" about a specific film especially if ""the majority of viewers seem to have missed the point."""
It is a tough job but someone has to do it.
So here is the skinny.
This is a terrible film.
The problems with it go far beyond casting choices that some other members actually caught.
The premise is terrible.
Hollywood could use a really good movie that explores the business ethics between generations.
This is not it.
The writing is terrible.
"This may not the fault of the writers, presumably they were following the ideas put in their head by the producers."
"Regardless of who is to blame, the script is soggy and lame."
"The most reliable ""reviewers test"" for an unknown film is the so-called 20 minute test."
"If a film fails to connect with the viewer by the 20 minute mark, it is a dud."
At the 20 minute mark De Niro is still settling into his new job.
There is no viewer connection or interest or suspense or pathos or empathy.
A dud.
"Rene Russo looks lost in her role and the scenes where she massages de Niro are embarrassing to the film, the cast, and Mankind as a whole."
"I could go on, but you get the point."
The Intern was a pretty enjoyable team-up of Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway Robert De Niro plays the title character as a retired widower who works for a company run by Anne Hathaway who's married with a pre-teen daughter.
"There are some amusing scenes and lines but this was mostly a pretty dramatic take on ageism, sexism, adultery, and the eternal question of whether one can have it all."
"As writer-director, Nancy Meyers goes through all this with earned heartfelt characters as portrayed by De Niro and Ms. Hathaway."
"When I agreed to watch this with my movie theatre-working friend, I wasn't sure I'd really like it but it was quite enjoyable for both of us from beginning to end."
Did things seem a little neatly-tied-up-in-a-bow at the end?
"Sure, but still it seemed natural so neither of us had any complaints...

I STILL HAVE THE MUSIC IN ME Ben (Robert De Niro) is 70 and retired.
He answers an ad for an Intern for a start up E-company that sells women's clothes.
"He says, ""I still have music in me."""
He quickly becomes an asset to the company and founder Jules Austin (Anne Hathaway) in a film formula way.
"Yes, the light comedy is predictable."
"It is a good date night film and it does turn into a romance as I once heard ""All the best pictures are romances."""
"It is a feel good film that was well acted, directed, and written."
One of the better of the plethora of films De Niro has done in the last few years And sometimes a feel good film is all we want.
Guide: 3 F-bombs (one texted).
No sex or nudity.
Somewhere here there might be buried a great 90-minute film .
"but Warner Bros. decided that they could make a profitable chick flick out of THE INTERN, so they stuffed it with half an hour of cellulose padding (since Rule #1 of chick flicks is, ""Don't ask the ladies to get up again for a couple of hours once they've settled into their seats"")."
"It's no easier to pinpoint all the excess baggage weighing down THE INTERN than it would be to body-sculpt the average film-goer packing on an extra 10 (or 50), but one might start with they boys' home break-in caper."
"Next, Paige's all-in-pink birthday party visit never would be missed, and why not excise either the adultery subplot or the company masseuse--your choice."
"Furthermore, that endless just-hanging-out-on-the-boss'-bed-in-bathrobes San Francisco bit might have been aiming for some blend of bittersweet poignancy, but it comes off more like a creepy exercise bordering on incest."
Just saying.
Vomit Bucket If your like me you'll need a bucket to be sick in by the end.
"The heartwarming music non stop, the unrealistic plot that runs through it all."
All the nice sickly people who love the world and everyone around them.
I'm surprised there weren't cartoon birds making an appearance at some point.
An absolute load of nonsense.
"Saying that, it passed the time while I played Toon Blast."
So unrealistically schmaaaltzy.
"Nancy Myers churns the stuff out, some hit some miss."
"There will be a lot of women out there that love this kind of stuff, I like my romcoms but I can't see any bloke liking this one."

The perfect movie The Intern ....
"The sweetest, most perfect And heart touching I have seen in a long time."
Of course it helps that Robert De Niro is there but what a movie!
This is what all movies should be.
"Robert De Niro plays the perfect gentleman, the kind we don't see anymore."
And every woman who sees the movie will fall a bit in love with him.
"Anne Hathaway perfectly plays the role of a successful entrepreneur, a working wife and mom who thinks about everything and everyone and still feels guilty about being a working woman, even after the perfect gentleman tells her He should not be the feminist amongst the two of them."
Every working woman will identify with her inner struggles.
"The story is perfect, with the perfect practical ending, as life is always more practical than idealistic."
"The small touches like the housewives who look down upon the working mom and make her feel guilty (I have seen many of those), the successful aggressive entrepreneur's fear of hurting her mom, the stay-at-home dad's end-of-day exhaustion that the working mom does not really understand and the young boss' discomfort with her elderly intern... All so real."
There's an idea here which I spoke about long back...
The huge talent pool of retired people nobody is willing to hire.
The intern's wisdom and practicality brings a calm and peace to the busy boss' life.
There's a lesson here for us all here.
Look at our elders and learn from them.
Stop a while in your busy life to get more out of it.
"Loved the movie, hope everyone of my generation sees it."
De Niro's Downward Descent Continues It's a sad thing to witness the fall of one of the all-time great actors.
"When someone like Robert De Niro turns up in a project beneath him like 'The Intern', you know they were only drawn to it because of the money."
"What's even more heart-breaking though is that when they take on more projects of this nature, they become less likely to be acknowledged for films like 'Raging Bull', 'The Godfather Part II' and 'Goodfellas' by general audiences."
Ben Whittaker is seventy years old; don't worry about remembering this figure as the film will constantly remind you like a nagging child.
He is not enjoying his retirement.
When a senior intern program shows up he jumps at the opportunity and ends up working with his bitter boss (a sickly sweet Anne Hathaway) she just happens to be younger than him.
"I'm frantically thinking of something, anything to say that's positive or of significant note about 'The Intern' but nothing is coming to my mind."
"All that I can say in its favour is that it never comes across as hateful about gender, culture or race."
"But if I'm praising the film for elements it does not include, should that really count as praise at all?"
What I can say is that 'The Intern' is as predictable as they come.
You could sit there with a checklist waiting to tick off every clich√© it indulges in.
Chances are all the boxes will be ticked by the end.
That is if you can make it to the end.
This alleged comedy is over two hours long and this self-indulgent runtime has never worked any favours for the genre.
I don't want to sit here criticizing 'The Intern'.
I would much rather praise a film than come off as cynical.
"But when a film is this uninvolving, dull and unfunny I just can't."
I trust you to make up your own mind about whether seeing 'The Intern' is the right thing to do.
So I pose these questions.
Do you want to see the fall of Robert De Niro?
A comedy so inert and flat that you can barely raise a smile?
An experience more torturous than a late night shift at work?
I do not want to see any of these things.
It just makes it all the more easy to decline this internship.
"Humorless drama In its television advertising The Intern is made out to be a comedy of some sort, perhaps a rom-com, maybe a dram-com, but anyway a light-hearted movie full of laughs."
It is not.
The Intern is just a lukewarm drama with a very few laughs.
What a shame.
It has a story line which is rich with possibilities for humor.
It could have been filled with moments of laughter and enjoyment.
"Instead it marches (at a v-e-r-y slow pace) right past many, many chances for delightful byplay between and among its characters."
Wasted chances and wasted time.
"DeNiro was repressed and restrained by the director, so much so that this powerful, spectacular actor adds little to the movie by his presence."
"Again, what a shame."
It's hard to sum up my disappointment with this movie.
3 out of 10.
condescending crappola Stereotypical nonsense.
Almost unwatchable.
Robert Deniro has one expression.
So old folks are wise and everyone lives in Brooklyn brownstones worth millions.
Not funny or endearing.
A depressed 70 year old widower becomes an intern?
Everyone at the firm is a millennial who has no knowledge of anything human including the owner.
Anne Hathaway's husband is a loser.
She is too cold.
Her firm is unbelievable.
How did her firm become prominent?
It sells clothes?
What a novel idea.
Best part is the shots of Brooklyn.
The dialogue is really dumb and predictable.
The situations come right out of a plot book.
I would have rated it a one but I saw it free on TV and mostly played on my phone during the movie so I did not have to watch it completely.
Hail to capitalism Horrific movie.
"Shallow acting, shallow and predictable story and the whole thing is celebrating unsustainable business (all clothes of the company made in Bangladesh for sure) fused by shallow Hipster-Mutants, who are poisoning our cities today, stuck in front of their screens in generic lofts for work and for living."
"I don't get, why De Niro is gambling with his reputation the last decade and I don't get, why anybody should waste time and money for this retarded vision of a working life, bound to phones and displays (prominent product placement on the movie of course), doing ""customer service"", while the real work is done by people in a prison of poverty."
"Get yourself a workshop, get yourself some dignity."

"A perfect mood setter, feel good movie!!"
The Intern brings you to the life of a 70 year old who doesn't want to live an average retired old man routine because he still feels he has music (metaphorically) left in him.
So he takes up a senior intern job at an online fashion site with a completely different environment and people than what he has worked all his life.
"He meets the founder and while working with her, becomes her confidant and mentor."
Story (8/10): The story is simple and very well knit.
It beautifully portrays how a Baby Boomer generation old school veteran brings peace and stability to a Millennial generation woman entrepreneur lost in the crazy and excruciatingly demanding business world.
The characters have been well conceptualized and sketched.
"What is interesting to see is how a rapid fire, anxious, no non-sense, always on top of everything boss (Anne Hathaway) works with a composed, experienced, twice aged intern (Robert De Niro)."
"Some of the scenes really touch your heart, especially the conversations between Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro."
I won't reveal it to spill the beans over here.
"At the end, it leaves you with some food for thought."
"Acting (9/10): With stalwarts like Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro, one doesn't really need to worry much about the acting."
The simplicity of the story didn't demand high levels of acting either.
"However, Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro does a great job at projecting the aspirations, principles, beliefs and challenges of both the generations on one plate, not just in terms of dialog delivery but also expressions."
The supporting cast does a commendable job too with the available screen time.
Direction(9/10): Nancy Meyers had struggled a little in her earlier movies but have learnt lessons on romantic comedy well and has got it right this time.
"The Intern is, however, more of a comedy rather than romance."
"While the plot was quite average, her execution skills elevated the movie to a different level."
I like the way she focused on projecting the synergies of two different generations working together rather than the friction which we normally see.
This gave the entire movie a very feel good factor.
She could have got away with some of the characters which would have kept the movie a little focused but overall a brilliant effort.
Overall (9/10): I watched this movie on a Saturday morning show and couldn't have asked for a better and positive start to the weekend.
"This movie is a mood setter and yes, it does it amazingly well."
A definite watch for everyone.
"For Robert de Niro Actually, I start love Robert de Niro after this movie."
This movie I like.
"Always think about old peoples career and I need, I want to talk with like this person."
And... Really really I love DeNiro.
This movie soo so so good!

No conflict.
Plastic characters living in Pleasantville My main problem with this movie is that it has no conflict until the 1h:25min mark and even then the conflict is underplayed and quickly resolved with no effort.
And since there's no conflict what's the point?
Not even the greatness of Robert de Niro can boost this movie to more than a 4/10.
"All the characters are perfect, plastic people, and everything is constant sunshine."
This movie should be categorized as a fantasy because there's barely a drop of real life in it.
This is the film equivalent of elevator music.

"Mood lightning, cheerful and real- A must watch It's a great watch and unusually real."
"You can easily relate to the characters specially if you've ever in life been an intern, you'll feel the nostalgia when you see Robert de Niro's Ben Whittaker all lively and pumped when he's selected as a senior-intern under Anne Hathaway's Jules Ostin."
"Like every newbie at work, although he is not, he longs to get some tasks and help his mentor in every way possible."
"In the beginning you pity the 70-year-old retired and widowed Ben for being slightly neglected or ill-treated by the workaholic, passionate, never tiring, ambitious and successful Jules, but that is short lived and He wins her confidence and heart in a couple of days."
The whole movie revolves around Ben's life and how he cheers up everybody around him all the time with his cuteness and wisdom.
The actors have done very decent work and you can easily gel in the movie and feel the life in it.
The music too is very jovial and sets your mood from the first minute of the runtime.
"The movie presents some very important aspects of the society in a very subtle yet effective way like how a woman is prejudiced at work or as leaders, how the new generation boys in the pursuit of being cool no longer remain a gentleman, marriage life problems etc."
"A pinch of comedy here and there adds up to the fun content, and a few personal life tensions of Jules balances it very beautifully and how She comes out of it is remarkable and worth taking lessons from."
"Overall a very good watch if you're looking to uplift your mood (which is always, because that's why people turn to movies)."
"Shocked that I liked it This really isn't usual thing, I mean so far from what I'd usually watch, but it's De Niro so I had to give it a try... And I loved it!"
"It was so heartwarming and feelgood, which is exactly what I need right now (my best mate passed away last night at 41)."
"De Niro is brilliant in this, the man really can play any character, I still think he's the number one actor in the world, (closely followed by Di Caprio) and Anne Hathaway was brilliant as well, she played the stuffy boss to a tee."
"I don't like giving spoilers or passing off a synopsis as a review (which so many people on here do) but if you want a good, wholesome, sometimes funny and just overall nice 2 hours then definitely give this a watch, you might even shed a tear, but you'll come away feeling better for it."
"Crack open a bevvy or a bottle of wine and enjoy, it's free on Prime right now...

8/10."
"Good roles good actors, who needs anything else Once again, the movie feels better than it is."
Because of the killer combo I refer to at the title.
"Every role is written here to perfection, even the tiniest ones."
Almost every person on whom the camera stays a few seconds gets a well defined character.
Good actors do wonders with good roles - I said it in my reviews more than once.
So the story is riddled with clich√©.
"Nancy Meyers does her share of milking the feminist agenda, as she so often does in her movies."
"But since we grow into liking the characters on screen we don't care, we don't even mind that they get the Hollywood way of problem solving, we all knew it was a Hollywood movie we were going to see."
"Now, since acting is so very important to the likability of this movie, I want to add some more general points."
I recently read a lot of complaints regarding De Niro's present casting a shadow over his glorious past.
And I do agree that not all his recent roles were up to par.
"So many great actors who really love acting suffer from the same problem that William Holden, one of the all time greats once even said to a novice, ""take every role you're being offered, if you're good enough you'll be remembered for the best of them"" - purist will find errors in my quote but that was the gist of what he said, and he did follow his own advise."
And so do many other great actors.
"And De Niro, make no mistakes, is one of the greatest, no matter how many mediocre roles he has down to his name."
"This one is one of his best roles in recent years, and he does it with his usual professional attitude and with his usual intelligence."
"No good actor is really stupid, to really understand the character you need to portray takes a brain."
"So some actors may be very shy or tongue tied, when they have to speak for them selves, don't mistake it for not having an opinion or not understanding what they're speaking about."
"Apart from De Niro Anne Hathaway also shines, and I also have to say some nice words about Rene Russo, who didn't have a significant role since god knows when."
"The actors do carry this movie through the field of movie clich√©, but they're all so good, it is fun to watch."
Beautiful and fashionable.
The Intern.
What can be said about this film?
This is a very kind and beautiful movie.

"Wisdom and Heart: A Winning Combo Here's De Niro surprising us with a performance that is far removed from just about everything he's done before, and it's a winning turn."
De Niro plays a retired man who joins the working world when he turns 70.
"Because of his background, he's kept up with technology and appears to be an old fashioned gentleman in an environment where dress codes are very relaxed and social etiquette is a thing of the past."
"Because of his congenial personality, he wins most of the workers over, and in the biggest ironic twist, he's assigned to the driven head of the company, a winning turn by Hathaway."
"It's really obvious that they will clash, but he's a gentleman, and she does appreciate a combination of heart and practicality."
"He observes how stressed is because she's dedicated to her career, and she tries to juggle her personal life, but it's an impossible task because there's too much to do."
"If one considers, that a marriage demands much commitment, and a company's head needs a strong supportive team, she's bound for disaster."
"But don't worry, De Niro comes and saves the day, and the best compliment we can give it is that it doesn't appear manipulative or far fetched."
"""The Intern"" will probably raise a few eyebrows out there with its team of marriage trouble, but one has to remember it's a comedy, and its message is that anything is possible if you try hard to reach for your dreams and always keep a positive attitude."
"You need a strong heart, a belief that you will succeed when you pursue your true passion."
"It doesn't deny that life can have some bumpy moments, but keep your chin up, find yourself some support, and you'll come through a winner."
"a feel-good movie The Intern centers around an elderly guy who gets hired by an upstart company, which only seems to employ millennials."
"Apparently someone threatened them with ageism, so they decided to start a Senior Intern program --- something I've never heard of."
That to me is at the heart of what makes this movie great.
"I mean, there either are companies out there using the concept of senior interns, or this movie's premise is completely original and I love originality."
"Concept aside, I imagine the script is a page-turner, because it's a movie that sucks me in and makes me interested in what's going to happen next."
"First this old intern gets a job with young whippersnappers, he's assigned to the owner of the company, she wants nothing to do with him, but their relationship begins to evolve when the old guy spots her driver sipping from a bottle before he has to take Jules somewhere."
"So ""Ben"" confronts him and the driver takes the day off (never to return)."
Ben ends up chauffeuring for Jules and later he shares a tasters choice moment in which he tells Jules the building they work in is the same one he worked in for 40 years.
"There are so many good moments in the film that I don't want to rehash, but if you like feel-good, I'd recommend this."
"Manly men probably won't like this because there really isn't any ""cool"" stuff, but I've seen the movie multiple times and haven't gotten sick of it."
"It is a pity to waste such a great idea Not a comedy, not a drama, unfortunately this film fails in the end to entertain."
"Even though the main idea is brilliant, the script unfortunately fails to deliver."
"There are at least four(4) parallel subplots going on: i) the retired widowed executive wishing to stay active, ii) a startup growing too fast for its founders to cope with, facing the urge of installing an external CEO, iii) the romance the ""intern"" finds and iv) the price the founder of the start-up needs to pay in the personal front with the husband cheating on her."
"Apparently the creators of the film wanted to see the plot in its holistic dimension, forgetting they just had 120min of film (too much for a comedy anyhow) to convey it to the audience."
"It is a pity, because the same set of actors could have delivered the perfect family experience; entertaining even moving; they just needed a different script."
Watch this.
"This is one of those very, very few films that left me with so much happiness that I kept smiling throughout the credits, reading each and every name of every person who contributed to this wonderful work of art."
"And I'm still smiling after it ended and yes, using a handkerchief to wipe away some tears."
"Just sitting here, thinking back, memorizing those lovely and touching moments that fill The Intern."
"From the script to the acting and soundtrack to the perfect little details in every scene and the way emotion just flows throughout it all, I just cannot recommend this enough."
Please do yourself a favour and watch this with an open mind-and especially an open heart.
"Don't watch the trailer or read reviews that contain spoilers, just let yourself be immersed in the story as it unfolds."
"""You talking' to me?"""
"This is the kind of movie I (like to) watch when sitting in a 10 hours flight, it kills time, you don't have to bother about the background noise of the engines muffling some beautiful score, you won't wake up your neighbors by laughing out loud and it's so boring that you do not need anything artificial to fall asleep."
Somewhere in the movie De Niro talks to himself in the mirror...
"I couldn't but see his younger version in Taxi Driver and for 1 second I was hoping that he WOULD say his famous line, then we would all have been reassured that it was all just a big parody, but he didn't (of course) and everything went downhill further along."
"Two stars nevertheless because De Niro does what he does best, do the De Niro and Ann Hathaway is not that bad an actress."

Robert De Niro was a delight!
"Such a lovely movie that underlines the importance of selflessness, patience, sensitivity, staying centered and calm in every situation."
"I love it that you can read every emotion from Robert De Niro's facial gestures, and his character in the movie."
It takes you to the times of the real gentlemen walking earth.
"Funny enough, I personally also identified with Anne Hathaway's role so much as a young woman entrepreneur."
"It's lovely that they pointed out the difficulties of being in such position in life as a young, strong woman."
"An absolutely great movie made, so much appreciated."
Cheers to everyone contributed!
my notes This was a nice movie with a nice story and good acting by the leads.
"I would probably recommend this to my mom (1 viewing)

"Internally Spectacular Let's begin with some very special quotes that I hope you'll catch the reference as instantly as I did:

""And Rachel?"
"Have a great wedding,"" says Jules (Anne Hathaway) and ""You're calling me 'Ace?'"
"That's like super cool,"" Jules to Ben (Robert De Niro.)"
"Truly, while I caught these, I might have missed so many more wonderful homages to these actor's other works."
"The first one, about the wedding, happened extremely early on and set the stage of me loving this film."
"In fact, I couldn't stop raving about it all day at work today after watching it last night."
"I do like Robert De Niro, though he hasn't always been in great roles or movies and for the most part, he's played the same character."
The 72- year-old actor might as well had his screen debut here.
"He was fresh, interesting and just perfect in the role of such an incredible character."
I praise both De Niro's acting and the part of Ben.
"While I also loved the entire movie, Ben's genuine senior intern stole my heart as he did for all the other character that rightfully flocked to him."
He was playing a 70-year-old who I would incredibly proud to be like when I reach that age in (gulp) under several decades.
"He was smart (waaay smart) with his money for his retirement, he didn't let anything get him down, he was always curious to learn more, set in his ways without judgment of anyone else and most importantly, he always put others first."
He was human and perfect at the same time.
"Beautiful ‚Äì strike that, gorgeous ‚Äì Anne Hathaway also was very good in her role, though even with her beauty, De Niro simply stole every scene from her."
"Not to take anything away from her, as she wasn't just crucial to the plot, but she still gave 100%."
"The remaining cast, including the always lovely and wish-we-could-see-more-of Rene Russo, the always cute Adam DeVine and Christina Scherer, were all wonderful to watch as well."
"Beyond the cast, the script, direction and cinematography all made the just over two hour film a breeze and never ceased to make me smile."
"It was hilarious, touching though never unconvincing and certainly moving with the example Ben leads."
"Retired Ben did everything he wanted to early in his retirement, but when the freshness wore off, he was afraid to whiter away."
"Fortunately, he found a new spark as a ""Senior Intern"" in a completely opposite young adult internet firm."
"At first, no one, including Jules, knew how to take him, but good ole Ben, unintentionally became the star, friend and mentor to everyone there."
"In no way did this movie feel unrealistic, or misguided to what could happen."
"It was so well written and driving, you could feel as if you were there in that office with him."
You'd want to be there.
You'd want to be Ben's peer and friend.
Another plus is that this was an adult comedy with minimal adult themes or gross out moments just to get the young men giggling.
"While I don't mind the crude humor films, √† la Seth Rogen's romps, it was thoroughly refreshing to have an adult comedy that didn't need it, care for it or use it as a crutch."
"Like Ben, it was pleasantly professional."
This isn't just a movie to see.
It's to buy and rewatch many times.
I know I can't wait to see it again and maybe remember the good ole ways_x0085_ that I wasn't even a part of.
"***

Final thoughts: Yes, and I'm sure this is true for many, Ben reminded me of my father."
"Many of his characteristics, mannerisms, old school methods and official politeness that my father shares blended into my life as well."
"I am not as old as Ben, as established above, but I believe I saw 100% of where all of Ben's habits, words and emotions came from."
"Growing up with my dad ‚Äì who will be the same age as De Niro's character in a couple of months, I saw his life from where he was raised and what he was taught, right from wrong, how to treat people and even carrying the handkerchief."
It was a nice reminder of my pop and maybe I should give him a call now
She is the centre of the universe Thats what the film is about.
And everyone should adapt their lives for her hapiness and success and be happy to do so.
And thats what they do in the film.
Its a 100% chick movie pampering to present female fantasies about life full of unrealistic characters.
De Niro was interesting in the beginning but than he becomes the daddy who supports his special princess girl.
"Movie with an actual message, for a change!"
It had been a while since I last saw a movie that was actually trying to teach you something.
A movie with a real message.
"And there was more than just one here, this movie had so much to say!"
"So much that we forget about these days, so much that we need to relearn."
Enjoyed watching this so much.
You're never to old to intern!
"Director/Writer Nancy Meyers (""It's Complicated,"" ""The Holiday,"" ""Somethings Gotta Give"") returns to the big screen with yet another mature family fun film about a senior (the ever so cool Robert DeNiro) coming back into the working world of twenty-somethings and workaholic Jules (the always beautiful Anne Hathaway)."
"Hathaway's character isn't far from her ""Devil Wears Prada"" spin, yet she understands these frazzled characters so well."
"Meyers not only understands how to present a relatable story, she perfectly fills the ensemble rolls with quality and memorable characters, including Rene Russo, Anders Holms (Workaholics - TV), Andrew Rannellis (GIRLS), Adam DeVine (Modern Family), Zack Perlman (Married), Christina Scherer, and veteran favorites Linda Lavin and Celia Weston (Alice) to name a few."
"""The Intern"" doesn't solve any ""senior/retirement"" moments, but it does remind one life isn't over until it's over."
"This film has Nancy Meyers written all of it, and that's a good thing!"

De Niro-Hathaway chemistry warms the heart The Intern managed to garner only a 51 score on Metacritic.
Why so?
"Written and directed by Nancy Meyers, whose ""It's Complicated"" I also admired, the film begins with a voice-over by one of the story's protagonists, Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro), a 70 year old widower whose life is empty due to the loss of his wife."
"At first he informs us being on his own for the first time in years was exciting, as he was able to travel around the world and experience new things."
"But once home, despite attempting to keep busy, he still feels alone."
Participating in seemingly uplifting activities such as weekly tai chi classes provides little solace as it does nothing to provide the companionship and a purpose in life which he so craves.
"Remarkably, the voice-over is revealed to be a video pitch, as Ben is applying to a Senior Citizen intern program at About the Fit, an online fashion startup founded and run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), a thirtyish bundle of energy whose workaholic ways jeopardize her family life at home (consisting of a husband and very cute young daughter)."
"If Ben's finding of the notice for the senior citizen intern program is the inciting incident, the ""call to adventure"" occurs after Ben passes all the interviews at the firm and is hired to be one of four interns."
"It's no accident that Ben finds that Jules's new internet startup is in the same building as his old employer, a defunct phone book manufacturer."
"In many ways, Ben retains the ""talismans"" of his old world‚Äîhis sage advice to many of the young male employees is always to keep a handkerchief in one's possession at all times, as it might come in handy to comfort a weeping female who might experience an emotional upset at an inopportune time."
"Just as the young employees at the startup warm up to Ben, who is at heart a good guy, Jules at her core is also quite sweet."
"She has a ""save the cat"" moment (the moment in the first act of a screenplay when the protagonist performs a good deed, highlighting a good nature)."
"This occurs when Jules promises a customer that she'll personally call the vendor who screwed up an order involving bridal gowns, have the gowns sent in time for the wedding and then refund the customer's money."
"When Ben is assigned to be Jules' personal intern, this gives him an opportunity to play the part of mentor (or father figure) to Jules and become (as he puts it during the initial narration) ""whole again."""
"When he spies Jules' chauffeur drinking on the job, he orders him not to drive her, thus saving her from harm."
"In an even more telling moment during the first half of the second act, Jules asks one of her aides to have Ben transferred because she fears he's ""too observant."""
Jules fears intimacy and hides under the mask of the driven boss.
"After two days of finding herself warming up to Ben, she forgets about her earlier request to have him transferred and finds herself apologizing to Ben after her aide carries out her earlier (but no longer extant) wishes."
"We might conclude that Jules too has experienced a loss and, like Ben, seeks to become ""whole."""
Would it be too much of a stretch to conclude that Jules's intimacy problem stems from competition with her mother for the love of her father‚Äîand that she identifies with the father who might have been an over-achiever like her?
"Indeed, it's the comic machinations at the midpoint that highlight Jules's friction with her mother."
"Ben, along with some of Jules's employees, break into Jules's parents' home, in order to delete a rather nasty and embarrassing email inadvertently sent by Jules to her mother by accident."
"The ""ordeal"" in the second half of the second act proves to be turbulent on the emotional level."
"Indeed, here it's Ben discovering that Jules's seemingly ""perfect"" husband is having an affair with a mother of one of the children their daughter is friendly with."
Jules is also aware of the affair and Ben helps Jules cope with the crisis in a frank but reassuring talk while on a business trip to San Francisco.
"On the ""road back,"" Jules must not only resolve the problem with her husband but decide whether to hire a CEO to replace her, which the investors of the company have been clamoring for."
The marital discord is resolved when Jules's husband unexpectedly shows up at the office and has a heart to heart begging forgiveness (Jules is more than willing to forgive him).
Again it's Ben's wise counsel that convinces Jules not to let the company be taken over by an outsider and potentially ruin everything she's achieved.
De Niro gives a remarkably sensitive performance as the man who steps in as a father figure at precisely the right time in order to assist the beleaguered Jules.
"He not only finds ""wholeness"" helping Jules and her employees but finds love with the startup's in-house masseuse (Rene Russo)."
"There is a telling shot towards the beginning of The Intern, where Ben is waiting for hours to see Jules and it's rather sad how he's all alone, and his adventure really hasn't begun."
"But after Jules has resolved her situation, Ben realizes that his time at the firm is up and he's accomplished all that he wanted to do."
"Now he pursues his tai chi class with vigor, having achieved the spiritual integration he was seeking."
It should also be noted that the chemistry between Anne Hathaway and De Niro is palpable.
There is something very warm about Hathaway's acting and her journey toward wholeness is cathartic.
"The Intern might have some moments of silliness, but it still touches the heart."
Bad The question you have to ask is why does this film get a 7 / 10 on IMDb but a 5 / 10 everywhere else?
This is the worst film i have ever seen.
Instead of watching this film you could just as easily place a gun in your mouth and when you feel the cold steel hit the back of your throat...pull the trigger.
If you find yourself on the floor and still lucid then take another shot near your temple and finish the job.
It says that my review is not long enough so I will also add that I really hope Robert Deniro got paid a hell of a lot of money to demean himself in this way.
At least films such as Meet the Fockers where he takes a side step from his serious acting was hilariously funny and had something to offer.
"This film on the other hand is aimed at an audience of 16 yr old buskers, coffee connoisseurs and activists."
"My girlfriend and i just switched off half way through...in her words "" this film is soft dribble """
"Like watching a train wreck occur over an hour and a half What do you get when you combine all of the memes and clich√©s of our shallow, tech-obsessed post-globalisation, hipster world and then have a wise, humble, dapper and old fashioned gent (Robert De Niro) as the ever congenial retiree intern."
What's baffling is De Niro's character.
"He has a complete lack of anysort of antipathy or disillusionment for finding himself in that situation - being bossed around the office and managed by people who have been on this planet for a quarter of the time he has, and who are genuinely childish, stupid and unprofesional."
In the real world - this sort of business which is completely devoid of any depth or intelligence would be hard to find.
Although the bad acting make this bag full of design agency clich√©s all the more hard to swallow.
This film is like a strange alternate universe and it is indeed like watching an atomic blast slowly unfold.
"Switched off twenty minutes in when I realised that these people were not behaving this way ironically, they were actually seriously attempting to portray a workplace of today."
Quite possibly the worst movie I've seen in my life.
"Likable light drama Following the death of his wife, 70-year old Ben feels a need to recover some purpose in his life, so he joins an up-and-coming internet fashion company under their mature intern program, and finds himself assigned to founder and CEO Jules Ostin."
"The company has grown to the extent that Jules is overworked and overstressed, and spends insufficient time with her young daughter and husband."
"She is initially disinclined to use Ben's skills, but he gradually begins to prove his value to her."
I'm beginning to get used to Hollywood creating misleading trailers.
"The trailer for this movie sells it strongly as a comedy, and it really isn't (apart from one slapstick burglary episode, which feels as if it belongs in a different movie)."
"Instead, what we have is a gentle ‚Äì and rather unsurprising ‚Äì drama, with some amusing moments, and likable performances from all concerned, with DeNiro unusually playing a character who is really rather ordinary (apart from a touch of OCD which, together with several other plot threads ‚Äì Jules' mother, an office romance ‚Äì goes unexplored)."
"DeNiro and Hathaway develop a pleasing chemistry and, if the main problems thrown up in the story get resolved a little too glibly, well, we do like a happy ending, don't we?"
"Senior citizen provides salutary model in modern office and lives In The Intern Nancy Meyers engagingly blends the old and new in terms of cinema, technology and feminism."
"Hero Ben is a feminist from the outset because his late wife Molly was a middle school principal, i.e., a woman who combined success in family and in administration."
So Ben appreciates the old feminism as well as the new that he sees in Jules (a man's name feminized by its homonym Jewels).
"As Jules notes, ""It's 2015, are we really still critical of working moms?"""
"Well, yeah, so Ben has to teach the other playground Moms the pride they should take in Jules's success."
"In business Ben unpacks his glass case, clock, calculator, pens, all superannuated ‚Äî before launching into the computer world."
He makes friends in the flesh as well as on Facebook.
"However new he may be to new tech, his old savvy in business, style and human relations proves a boon to the others."
One young guy buys a classic briefcase on eBay.
Robert De Niro is an affable Old Man in the New Age spirit.
"He actually weeps a bit, sentimental mush that he admits to being."
The established old geezer occupies the same role in the casting as his character does in the plot ‚Äî he's the man of experience and wisdom who provides a model for the young bloods.
"De Niro could be on the list of old actors that Jules cites as the lost generation of Men: Harrison Ford, Jack Nicholson."
"The film clip of Gene Kelly evokes an even earlier generation of softer, romantic men, suggesting the cycle of changing styles in film manhood."
"De Niro even plays against his own persona, when he serves as Jules's driver and when, before his interview, he rehearses his looks in the mirror."
"Shades of ""You talking' to me?"""
The heist scene is described as an Ocean's 11 play but it also hearkens back to De Niro's Scorsese gangster period.
"As Jules, Anne Hathaway exercises her own reputation as a difficult person to work with."
Her boss character here is a promotion from the harried gofer she played in The Devil Wears Prada.
She's warmer and more effective than the earlier Meryl Streep character.
Jules's drunken bar speech is central: as girls have grown into women on the American social landscape men have reverted to boys.
"Her husband is as sloppy, effete and juvenile as Ben's workmates."
"The husband had a brilliant career ahead of him, prioritized Jules's to become a stay-at-home father, then slips into the tired old clich√© of adulterer."
"The film is sensible in playing a 70-year-old as a sane, capable person, even still capable of having a sex life."
Ben's affair with Fiona is played with taste and discretion.
"Some might add ""hope."""
"The film's one weak spot is its treatment of the shorter, homelier, much more wrinkled woman who pursues Ben and gives him the finger when she sees him with Fiona."
Both in script and direction Meyers shows such sensitivity and grace in this film that it's disappointing to see her lapse here into the clich√© comedy of the predatory crone.
Rene Russo gives Fiona a dignity and attractiveness that might have also been accorded the other woman.
Instead Meyers went for the cheap laugh ‚Äî in an otherwise more serious work.
A feel good film!!
A Must watch!!
The Intern is a comedy-drama film directed by Nancy Meyers.
"The film stars Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway, Rene Russo, Anders Holm, Andrew Rannells, Adam DeVine, and Zack Pearlman."
A 70 year old widower applies for an internship in an online fashion site and soon becomes everyone's favorite.
This film is indeed a feel good and beautiful film which start giving you positive vibes as the film starts and gives a satisfying feeling as the film ends.
The film is beautifully supported by brilliant acting by Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway.
"The plot of the film is fresh and it's execution is superb, the entire film is graceful and keeps a smile on your face and keeps you motivated."
The music of the film backs the film beautifully.
"The screenplay of the film is superb and makes you smile, happy, rejuvenated and might make you cry as well."
Acting as mentioned earlier is superb by the lead stars and is beautifully supported by the support cast.
The end of the film could've been little more refined.
A beautiful film to watch.
"Meaningful scenes feel forced I don't necessarily dislike this film, but it has way too many cheesy/cringey moments for me to enjoy it."

Don't want to sound bitter.
But.

Cheerful music from Sims games playing on the background.
"Maybe for someone this movie will be a nice, relaxing get-away-from-it-all."
But I did have a feeling that the lady-boss is put out there as almost a saint.
"All her employees love and adore her, although she NEVER acknowledged their existence nor knew their names."
"All of that ""candy land"" was a little bit too much for me."
For me even the amazing actors didn't save this movie.
"Which instead of it's intent- to make me smile, made me roll my eyes up, because I already see too much fake perfection around to add more to it."
"The Intern 9/10 - classic Nancy Meyer flick that is super sweet and feel-good

Elders are Really Useful Robert DeNiro stars as an retiree that is bored with retirement and that he goes to work reluctantly as a senior intern hence the title to Anne Hathaway a wife and mother.
He may not be tech savvy like people of today like the Generation Z and Millennial groups.
But he does offer wisdom and comfort and proves you need to give people his age a chance.
Anne's character is a married mom but also has a thriving business.
Really proves you can have it all.
With profession and personal life there.
Take life but no yourselves seriously.
"Massive yawn fest the 2 stars are for De Niro, he is an actor of such high caliber that is wasted in this wishy washy flick."
The premise is a good one and something that could have been taken to more places than this film did.
Anne Hathaway is OK in her role but given the material she has to work with she struggles to show any brilliance.
Mr De Niro is also hamstrung in his role as he seems to not be able to develop fully as a character.
the drama what there is of it leaves you not really caring what happens to the people in this film.
"it is watchable, sadly predictable and too light and airy for my liking."
Also I think the lack of a protagonist in this film is its hugest flaw.
there is little serious conflict and not a lot of comedy.

"No charm, no wits, no drama, nothing This is one of my most boring and horrible experiences in cinema."
"At first I thought it was just going to be a little generic and predictable, but mostly harmless."
"A sub-par version of ""Driving Miss Daisy"" and ""The Devil wears Prada""."
"Then, it entered the second part, and everything went to hell."
"Seriously, the last hour of this film felt like 4 or 5, easily, with stupid situations going absolutely nowhere, horrendous dialogues, no character development, no change at all in any of them, and lots of cryngy moments."
"To summarize it, this film had so many sub-plot going on all at once that it couldn't decide what type of film it was."
"It was not a comedy, it was not a drama, it was not a romance, it had no meaning, no pay- off, nothing to say about old people working and their impact on their life and the effect on the younger generations, except for a few jokes at the beginning."
"De Niro character was way too happy to need to work there in the first place, and was this ""angelic"" character that everyone loves, and Hathaway was at most a stressed-out woman, nowhere near as a bad person or someone rude to her employees."
"In the end, the characters almost didn't change at all."
"At most, Anne Hathaway got to relax a bit, but that's pretty much it."
"There were no character arcs for any of them, and no one learns anything or changes in any way."
"The husband/boyfriend (don't remember if they were married or not...) is a terrible person at the beginning and was just exactly the same at the end, the little girl ""struggle"" to not see enough of her mom went absolutely nowhere, neither how the younger interns dealt with their lives..."
"This movie was horrible, with its stupid music underlining every little moment, with its horrible pacing that made the last hour feel like at least four, with its horrible message about relationship, with all his terrible clich√© on old people and working women, and people in the larger sense."
"There was no heartwarming moments at all, no character felt vulnerable in any way, or relatable at all."
"The dialogues were tremendously bad, going absolutely nowhere, bringing us nothing, no wit or enjoyment or comedy."
Which is very bad for a film resting entirely on people talking.
One of the worst piece of trash I've seen in my life.
"PS: I love Anne Hathaway and respect De Niro, and I enjoyed ""The Holyday"" from this director, so it has nothing to do with any prior prejudice against anyone in this film."
"If anything else, Hathaway and De Niro are the ones that made me going to this movie."
"Thank you, guys, really."
"Still like you though, actors still got to eat."
Still...
A simple & heartwarming tale that people of any age can relate to.
"The Intern tells the story of a widower named, Ben Whittaker(Robert De Niro)."
"Apart from being a widower, Ben is also retired."
"One day, while going about his mundane everyday routine, he comes across a flyer."
"This flyer says, an up and coming online fashion website is doing a senior internship program & is looking for senior interns with years of work experience."
"The fashion website is founded & run by, Jules Ostin(Anne Hathaway)."
Ben seizes this golden opportunity to get back in the game.
"Ben spreads a positive attitude among his colleagues & his positive outlook, also rubs off on the usually uptight Jules."
The Intern is an outstanding film.
The simplicity of the movie is what makes it so perfect.
"The film perfectly balances the comedic moments & the dramatic moments, & is a flawless fusion of comedy & drama."
The break-in set piece is definitely one of the highlights of the movie.
"When the movie is funny, it's laugh-out-loud funny."
"However, there are several moments where the movie tugs at your heartstrings."
"The story of the movie might be simple however, director Nancy Meyers has done such a good job with the film that, it's this very simplicity that makes it flawless."
The performances are another highlight of the film.
Robert De Niro is outstanding as Ben.
"De Niro has starred in famous comedy films like the Meet the Parents trilogy however, his character in this film is extremely charming & likable."
Very different from his role as the suspicious father-in-law in those movies.
Anne Hathaway is outstanding as Jules.
"Hathaway gives a power packed performance & portrays all the ups & downs her character goes through, effortlessly."
Rene Russo is brilliant as Fiona.
Anders Holm is great as Matt.
JoJo Kushner is adorable as Paige.
Andrew Rannells is good as Cameron.
Adam DeVine is awesome as Jason.
Zack Pearlman is hilarious as Davis.
Jason Orley is impressive as Lewis.
Christina Scherer is amazing as Becky.
Linda Lavin & Celia Weston are hysterical in their small roles as Patty & Doris.
The Intern is a must watch for everyone who enjoys feel-good movies.
Refreshingly a feel-good movie!!
"After watching series of action/thrillers I wanted something light and fun-loving, and I found out this."
This film is really peacefull and a perfect family drama.
Anne Hathaway and Robert de Niro's performance were very natural and subtle.
The duo's chemistry is the driving force of the film.
Very good writing and direction as well.
Don't waste your time!
What wishy washy nonsense!
"Weak story, one-dimensional, boring stereotypical characters!"
Filled with endless clich√©s and improbable situations.
"Sickly sweet and unrealistic behavior of the main characters, far removed from reality."
Why can't they make good movies anymore?!
I suffered through 2 hours of it.
"I guess I was hoping for a miracle, for a twist that would elevate it above the level of a filler."
"But no, to the very end it kept the quality of adolescent slush with no depth or sophistication."
I guess I can't expect more from an Anne Hathaway movie.
What a waste of time!
I recommend that you give this one a miss.

"Fun Workplace Story Turning from fun to heartfelt, The Intern does a lot of things right in this drama-comedy."
"De Niro plays the endearing lead as the retired widower returning to work far below his expertise, to assist the workaholic Hathaway who is yet to discover a hands-off approach."
"One character quite fresh, the other fairly well known."
"An array of characters each with their own small dilemmas to overcome are fed in to the wider plot, creating more of a holistic workplace story, whilst never delving into anything serious like the leads."
"Parts can be predictable, others entirely shoe-horned in to provide a closing scene on unimportant tertiary characters, but that doesn't stop the plot from being fun and at times heartwarming."

"Delightful and well written, moving and funny Good job Nancy Meyers for creating another enjoyable delightful (not silly), grown up comedy with likable characters."
A Brooklyn startup hires a senior intern.
This movie has a lot more going for it than just generational and age difference jokes as seen on the trailer.
The plot is equally about a modern career woman running a start up and her juggling her kid and stay at home husband - a real modern family.
This is equally Robert De Niro's movie and Anne Hathaway's movie.
He is relatable and likable and wise and she is stylish and shows the many sides of her character.
Brooklyn is attractively shown with pretty brownstones inside and out and parks.
This is one of those comedies that can be watched again because it's so pleasing original well written beautifully filmed and well acted.
There are quite a few laugh out loud moments and many chuckles throughout plus some moving moments.

"A ""Must-Watch"" Comedy that Beats All Expectations!"
"Add The Intern to your list of ""must-watch"" movies because this delightful comedy beats all expectations."
"The film is about charming, 70-year-old Ben Whittaker, played by Robert De Niro, and his quest to join the work force after already being retired."
"Upon receiving the position of a senior intern at an online fashion website, he finds himself bonding with all the other young co- workers and is immediately loved by everyone."
"Ben is then assigned to intern for the owner of the company, Jules Ostin, and their opposite personalities create a bond between them that helps them through their lives."
"The film's outstanding choice of actors really impacts the quality of the movie because if Robert De Niro didn't play Ben, I wouldn't have been as attached to his character."
"The character development is the biggest aspect of the movie and, since they use great actors, they successfully win the hearts of the audience and build a bond with the viewer instantly."
I am really impressed with the comedy because I feel as though comedies these days are too desperate to be funny and it's really obvious.
They often throw in as many famous people as they can and have an under-developed plot to make the movie feel like a joke that should not be taken seriously.
"The Intern, however, is hilarious while remaining sophisticated."
It is surprisingly funny and I caught myself cracking up all the time.
The plot is very well developed and includes plot twists and a climax that I honestly would not expect.
The ending is fulfilling which saved me from my fear of being left hanging or disappointed since the whole movie leading up to it is amazing.
"The film is enjoyable for people of all interests, ages and genders because it's an all around feel-good movie that you don't need to be in a certain mood to watch."
The dialogue is insanely natural and realistic which makes it hard for me to believe that the lines are from a script.
The little details like facial expressions or even a comment said under a character's breath really made the movie authentic.
I also enjoyed the amazing storyline and moral messages.
I will definitely watch this film again and encourage my friends and family to watch it as well because it is worth seeing.
This film is best suited for ages of 13 to 18 as well as adult and I give it 4 ¬Ω out of 5 stars.

A Delight!
Nancy Meyers's 'The Intern' is A Delight!
"Its sweet, uncomplicated & thoroughly charming."
"And The Leads, are simply brilliant!"
The Intern' Synopsis: 70-year-old widower Ben Whittaker has discovered that retirement isn't all it's cracked up to be.
"Seizing an opportunity to get back in the game, he becomes a senior intern at an online fashion site, founded and run by Jules Ostin."
I haven't enjoyed a film off late as much as I did while watching 'The Intern'.
"This is a clean entertainer, that can be watched with your entire family, despite a few adult references."
"Its a beautiful story about aging, love & life."
"The unlikely friendship between its Protagonists, is a shining example of why this comedy works so wonderfully."
No one does lighthearted films better than Meyers & 'The Intern' finds her at her finest.
"Her Screenplay, though not perfect, is still well-penned & also heartfelt."
"Meyers's Direction is perfect, handling all the emotions on-screen, with flourish."
Stephen Goldblatt's Cinematography is bright.
Robert Leighton's Editing is pretty good.
Art & Costume Design are satisfactory.
Performance-Wise: Bob De Niro & Anne Hathaway are the life & soul of 'The Intern'.
"De Niro is effortlessly charming, delivering a richly layered performance."
"Hathaway, on the other-hand, is simply remarkable, adding tremendous depth to her part."
"And the on-screen chemistry between the two Oscar-Winners, is the highpoint of the enterprise."
"Supporting them wholeheartedly, is the Wonderful Rene Russo, who's lovable here & Adam DeVine who shines as one of De Niro's colleagues."
"On the whole, 'The Intern' is must watch."
"Easily, The Sweetest Film of the year so far!"
Nancy Meyers does it once again!
"Nancy Meyers's newest film, The Intern, starring Anne Hathaway, Robert De Niro, and Rene Russo is very entertaining and well made."
The chemistry between all the actors was impeccable!
This movie has some of the best chemistry between characters I've seen in a while.
Robert and Anne were absolutely delightful here!
"All the performances by all the actors were very good, light hearted, funny at times, emotional and just makes you happy to watch."
"The script and dialogue was pretty good, very heart warming and enjoyable."
The Intern is just a good old fashioned feel good heart warming fun movie that I think anyone could and would enjoy!
"Not that I expected it to be bad at all, I mean come on, it's Nancy freaking Meyers!"
"Go watch all the Nancy Meyers movies, every one of them!"

Absurd.
Corporate Life Isn't This Perfect My Friends.
"Credit can be given to this film for its truly funny bits, but The Intern is ultimately bogged down by two inconveniences: a seriously crappy storyline & amateur screenplay."
"The setting pushed by the film borders the impossible, as Robert De Niro's character seems to receive all conveniences handed to him, in a silver platter."
"It is also quite bothersome, that the character can do no wrong, receiving applause for the most shallow of reasons."
"It is then a sorry attempt to force the likability of a lead through absurd outcomes, that expectedly backfired."
"As for the screenplay, talk about amateur hour."
"Not only is the actual script unimpressive, the dialogue felt absolutely staged."
"Conversations were stiff & ""acting"" was all too obvious."
"In summary, this not a good film plain & simple."
"Performances by both RDN & Anne Hathaway were passable, but the way this film was crafted, felt B movie-ish."
5/10.
"A beautiful, touching film This was an absolute joy to watch."
"To see how Ben has impacted the lives of the people around him, to bring joy to their lives."
This was beyond a doubt an absolutely splendid feel good.
"But yet at the same time, it was more than that."
It showed the (albeit glorified) but true potential that an experienced worker can bring to a workplace.
Truly a marvel.
"Happiness I love this movie, it makes me so happy."
"It's a feel good movie, and you deserve gratitude for it

"THIS TYPE OF FILMS WHICH BRINGS YOU JOY WHEN YOU WATCH IT From time to another, we need to watch such a simple and joyful movie without too complications."
Deniro's character always makes you smile and makes you feel happy like he does to other characters in the movie.
The only problem in the movie is the second half which in my opinion is a little bit direct and focusing on only one point.
Almost perfect Correct me if I'm wrong...
I just does not like the ending.. the other than day.. it was perfect although I watch it in the cinema when it was release and rewatched it a couple of times.. before I found out that I never really got the chance to rate it.. so I decided to rewatched one more time in order to rate it.
"The movie was flawless, feel good time, inspiring and motivational for start up, youngster and old a like

The chemistry bond between Ben and Jules were uncanny

Everyone played their part so well with the script and direction too

Why I did not gave the movie 10 stars is because of the ending which I prefer Jules to have hired the CEO on the point of view to ease up her work load and to expand her business."
Like her colleague saying be there or be square.
It's a pity such a good premise dissolved into a kind of oblivion It starts OK.
Goes into an interesting situation pretty much unassuming.
There are a few good jokes.
"You see glimpses of DeNiro ""from the good old days""."
"But, slowly yet steadily, it dissolves into a half-hearted feminist propaganda."
"DeNiro clearly doesn't buy the ""I shouldn't be the feminist here"", even though he does deliver it like a pro."
It could have actually been better if the feminist agenda got carried through all the way.
"One would like it or not, but, it would be that kind of a movie (an ""agenda movie"")."
"Like this, ""half-way through"", it just doesn't feel it's going anywhere."
"Of course, the best thing would have been just to continue and finish like they started, without any agenda, just telling a story about an interesting situation."
Could have been really good.
DeNiro and Hathaway do play good together.
Writing showed obvious talent.
It's a pity.
"The ultimate feel-good moving I started watching this movie expecting to see some corny romcom movie, good to pass the time I while simultaneous checking my email and facebook."
"I was surprised to find a movie that was 100% positive, with no mean people or bad things happening."
I was even more surprised that it wasn't corny or boring.
"It was entertaining and gave me only positive emotions (and believe me, I get annoyed very easily)."
I didn't even mind the slightly feminist tone it took.
Probably the great actors had something to do with it.
It is not a cinematic masterpiece.
The story isn't very challenging or specially clever.
But it still was a great movie.
"I think it is 100% the movie it is supposed to be

Screenplay Needed an Intern.
"The Intern (2015): Dir: Nancy Meyers / Cast: Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway, Rene Russo, Anders Holm, Adam DeVine: Absolutely boring comedy about relating to those least likely."
"Robert De Niro plays Ben Whitaker, a senior who answers an ad that is open to senior interns at a fashion company."
"Anne Hathaway plays JulesOstin, CEO of the company who reluctantly gets paired with Ben."
This turns out to be a plus for her when he ends up being a positive force both in and out of work.
She begins to rely on him and this is where Nancy Meyers goes wrong.
The humour is either too subtle or completely over the top.
Three embarrassing scenes stand out.
One involves an overworked grieving secretary whose whimper should have called for either recasting or several more takes until she got it right.
"Next we have Adam DeVine, who was so good in the Pitch Perfect films, get shafted into a dreadful scene where he plays watch-out while listening to head phones."
Anders Holm as Ostin's cheating husband gives a hideous plead for forgiveness that is laughable and unconvincing.
De Niro does his best playing someone who can work under pressure while boosting those around him up.
Hathaway is unfortunately subdued in bad writing that is beneath her.
"Rene Russo shows up briefly to give De Niro a massage, which prompts cheers from the office."
"Theme regards not being too old to be useful, but also being able to assist future generations reach higher potential."
Unfortunately for Meyers that potential is not met here.
Instead we have a comedy devoid of laughs and works better than a sleeping pill.
Score: 2 ¬Ω / 10
Very sweet movie Greetings from Lithuania.
"""The Intern"" (2015) is probably one of the cheesiest movies you will in many moons."
"It is so sugar sweet, that sometimes i wanted to roll my eyes."
But it's not that it is not a good movie.
"It is a good movie, solidly acted by all involved, script is involving."
"Directing was very solid, at running time almost 2 hours this movie never drags."
"It is of course predictable as hell, but i liked the overall experience."
"You can watch this movie with a while family - this is more like a super sweet good feel family movie rather then a comedy, and there is some super sweet good humor."
"Overall, ""The Intern"" is not a straightforward comedy as you might thing from seeing the poster or reading synopsis."
It is a very sweet and sometimes funny movie.
"It's the one where EVERYTHING is super cute and sometimes shamelessly sweet, but it is a very good movie for a quite Sunday evening."
"Did De Niro intern ""The Intern""?"
"""The Intern"" (2015) written and directed by Nancy Meyers I thought was a much weaker film than some of her excellent earlier work such as ""Something's Gotta Give"" and ""It's Complicated""."
"First off, I thought Meyers had problems settings the stage for the premise of the film, particularly in terms of the company run by Jules (Anne Hathaway)."
"More than that, I was not enamored by her performance."
I think Ben (Robert De Niro) was a slightly strange casting call to play the retired cute guy.
"Because he is De Niro he still nailed it, but I just prefer him as his usual alpha bad-ass character."
He might actually have been interning for this part originally intended for Morgan Freeman.
"Furthermore, his relationship with Fiona got off a little strange but cute as well."
"Still, the film had moderate entertainment value, although it was very predictable."
"All in all, I thought it was a relatively weak achievement by Meyers, especially compared with her earlier excellent work."
"Top notch with fine performances by DeNiro and Hathaway I hadn't heard much about this film, but I like Robert DeNiro (in his non-gangster roles) and I like Ann Hathaway."
"And, I hadn't been to a movie in a while, so I thought -- what the heck."
"I was surprised on a Wednesday afternoon how big the audience was, admittedly mostly seniors (including me)."
You know how every once in a while a film just all fits together perfectly?
"Well, this is one of those films."
"Absolutely delightful, perfect casting, with just a little tension because you're not sure where things are going."
Will the senior intern become ill (almost seems so for a while).
Will he become the CEO being sought?
Will she retire?
"If Robert De Niro is in a film that is not gangster related (in a broad sense), I'll be there (especially as he has matured)."
"And here, as the senior intern, he is something special."
"Anne Hathaway, as the company founder, impressed me here, particularly when she cried."
Notice that her crying seems real...she gets all red in the face and just looks terrible.
She had a nice mix of vulnerable and in-charge scenes.
Rene Russo was interesting as the massage specialist (and love interest for DeNiro).
"Anders Holm was quite good as Hathaway's husband, although he had probably the worst looking beard I've ever seen in a film."
Nice to see Andrew Rannells as an executive at the company.
Adam DeVine was quite entertaining as an associate with little luck with women.
"Zack Pearlman, as another intern, was off-beat but entertaining."
Interesting to see Linda Lavin as an older woman out to snare DeNiro.
The story is quite simple.
"Hathaway founded a woman's clothing company, and runs it all herself, while still having a family where a ""house husband"" plays the at-home role."
"But, he's having an affair, in large part because she has no time for him."
"Andrew Rannells wants to institute a senior intern program, and DeNiro becomes the intern for Hathaway."
"At first she doesn't like him, or the concept, and asks to have him transferred...although quickly realizes he has helped her center her life a bit."
"They become very close, with the big question being how can her marriage survive, and will DeNiro guide her to a good solution."
It's difficult for me to think of something to criticize.
It seems all pretty perfect.
I guess I could for more characters who shave.
But aside from that I wouldn't want to change anything.
"Incidentally, the daughter, JoJo Kushner, is terrific."
Just sit back and savor a very fine movie.
"Cute Doesn't Cut It Overall, and a lot of people have said this, The Intern is cute."
But cute doesn't cut it.
The plot is silly--a seniors intern program at an online clothing upstart.
The characters are flat but not without their charm.
And the writing is scattered.
"While The Intern does have some touching moments and a few cute jokes about the novelty of the situation, it comes incredibly short as it feels like a bunch of ideas are being pulled together and held in place by DeNiro and Hathaway."
"Take a little Lost in Translation (complete with a platonic hotel bathrobe scene), throw in a little Baby Boom (an earlier Myers script) with a career woman trying to have it all, and finish it with over-the-top hipster caricatures."
"And the subplot of Jules (Hathaway) trying to find balance at home...by the looks of it, her husband didn't HAVE TO be a stay-at-home dad."
He could've kept his job and they could have lived quite comfortably with child care arrangements.
But then you wouldn't have a subplot.
Wait for this one to come out on Netflix.
Baby Boom is a lot cuter anyway.
Lovely I liked the movie so much... lovely story ..!
"Recommend you to watch it if you have a bad day, for sure you are gonna smile during watching it ... Roberto De Niro such a legend üòç

"never too old to learn new ways I like Nancy Meyers directing style ( the Holiday, Something's Gotta Give).The cast of the Intern is a good ensemble of Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway and Rene Russo."
"the movie has class, simple funny lines and an easy and natural flow of words."
Anne Hathaway as Jules and Robert De Niro as Ben have excellent conversations.
I liked the way the scenes after Ben sees Jules husband Matt with another woman are handled.
Ben's discomfort and conflicts between his true feelings and reality checks are beautiful.
Rene Russo is a healthy distraction in the movie.
"Among all the unfamiliar faces for me in the movie, I particularly liked Andrew Rannelis as Cameron."
He was excellent as Jules friend and manager.Some scenes involving Jason (Adam DeVine) needed editing.
Nice to see Ben see things Jules way.
good screenplay.
Good for the young and the old.
See things differently.
We learned that from former First Lady Hilary Clinton.
Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway have beautiful chemistry together.
The intern turned out to be a great movie to sit though.
"I herd I was not going to like it, but that was so not true."
"No matter what the movie is about it all comes down to the relationship between Ben Whitaker a 70 year old widower looking to keep active in order to prevent death,and Jules Ostin, a young woman who runs a successful company that Ben comes to intern for."
"I seemed out of touch with some of the characters being portrayed in the film, but the performances of such fine actors under the direction of Nancy Meyers makes a timeless piece about what two people can give to each other."
I would have never though of De Niro and Hathaway being paired in such a matter but they work so well on screen together.
It's worth taking a look at.

"Not so silly, worthwhile and touching Well, if you love Robert De Niro, if you love Anne Hathaway and if you happen to be in this line of work (startups, companies, etc."
"), then this movie will not be anything shorter that brilliant!"
"Performances are amazing, an excellent supporting cast and a 100% capture of the office reality and the different types of people within."
"100% to the spot with all this hip generation and the new fad of startups, etc."
"The plot, although a bit expected, manages to combine all the little things that are paramount to the everyday of any working person in time-consuming positions."
The gentle intrusion of De Niro as a pensioner that brings his own demeanor and outlook on things is invaluable.
"De Niro through his character shows to all of us, fast-paced, time- deprived and life-deprived generation X or Y or whatever, that there's always room for calmness and for living."
"It's a movie that is actually a lesson in disguise, that no one should miss."
"Not the most elaborate philosophy behind it, but isn't life supposed to be simple??"
Feel good movie!
"I wasn't too sure about watching this movie, but I'm glad I watched it..."
"Rob De Niro, plays a elderly intern character that everybody loves to have around, no sinister motives or anything like that, just a very feel good guy you want to have around!"
"It's a total opposite to Devil Wears Prada format... intern takes Anne Hathaway as the boss of a company she creates and it's ruining her private life as she's driven and committed, but she's not like Meryl Streep's character she starred in!"
There are some hilarious moments!
I'm not used to seeing DeNiro doing a film like this but he does it well!
"It's a 1,000 time's opposite to all his hard man films!"
"Just noticed A.... A...Ron, actor Zack Pearlman, had to rack my brains where I remember him from.. Key&Peele."
Substitute teacher!
"Robert de Niro was made for this movie :D Robert de Niro was perfect for this role, he was pretty old compared with his new collegues and still managed to do stuff better than them even if he had absolutely no clue how things work."
"He was always dressed at costume and his suitcase, old school stuff."
"Hes boss was played by Anne Hathaway an smart young lady which had a hard life and tried so hard to keep her business afloat + combining with her real life marriage... even if she wasnt crazy about the new intern and kind of ignored him, he really managed to find a spot in her heart and got close to her."
"I would love to be 80 and have his vitality and will to live :D.

big misfire I have seen Hallmark movies that were way more entertaining than this.
"The first hour of the movie is sort of interesting and cute, but the remainder of the film is pretty mediocre, with the last half hour being talky, excruciatingly boring, and predictable."
"There are other problems here, too."
"There is absolutely no chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Anders Holm, who play a married couple."
Maybe that's because Holm is such a lousy actor.
And the movie is loaded with cliches.
"For example, Holm is a stay at home dad while his wife works."
"So, of course, he has to dress like a slob and have a ratty beard."
Stuff like that abounds here.
"DeNiro gives a very controlled performance (is he bored, too?)"
"and one wonders if, 40 years ago when he was heralded as America's greatest living actor, he would have even considered doing tripe like this."
"But, time and finances changes everything !"
"Great going even in 70's Anwar Says: Read somewhere that Deepika Padukone is going to produce remake of INTERN , with Late Rishi Kapur ,but after his death recently announced Mr. Bachchan in the lead ."
This prompted me to watch the original and I found it on Netflix.
"Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway starrer, written and directed by Nancy Meyers and she has been able to squeeze every ounce of the star quality of the duo."
"A retiree joins a successful startup as senior intern and was assigned the job of aide of top boss , who moves on bicycle inside the office."
"She initially finds him extra observant and nosy but later appreciates him as a true friend, philosopher and guide."
"The affability and helpfulness is the key of the character Ben and there is a lot of inter- generational exchange and Jules,the heavily burdened career oriented woman, at one point of time helps him to make Facebook account."
"Meyer's articulate direction has succeeded in making Ben winning the trust of Jules to the extent, she discusses her husband's extra- marital relationship and the Man Friday reunited them ."
The ten seconds self - description by De Niro and the masseur Rene Russo has been superbly conveyed.
I can't doubt the caliber of Mr. Bachchan but the natural delivery of Mr. Niro would be always comparable.
"Waiting eagerly for the Indian Version, a next year release."

Its a must watch from my end.
A terrific movie!
I will admit that I ain't quite sure what to expect from this movie when I sat down to watch it.
"Boy, what I got was terrific movie, one of the best of 2015, IMO."
De Niro gives his best performance in years.
"He's often come across as a bit samey in recent years, like he's just playing the same guy over and over again, almost wooden."
"But in this movie, he manages to re-animate and plays his part superbly."
He shows great skill in delivering his lines with just the right air of worldly-wise experience and charm.
Anne Hathaway has become one of my favourite actresses.
"She really turning in some great performances since she, IMO, broke out in ""The Devil Wears Prada""."
She always seems so genuine and has a smile that lights up the screen.
"She struck just the right note of disarray, her work life blossoming and her family life withering away."
"The supporting cast, particularly the other interns, were excellent."
"A special word for JoJo Kushner, who played Paige, Anna Hathaway's daughter."
She's a complete natural.
"In fact, the chemistry amongst the cast really shone through."
I thoroughly recommend seeing this movie if you haven't already done so.
You won't be disappointed!
"the intent of sweet and fun sweet , beautiful and a big feel good movie ."
"very good and entertaining , great performances by Anne Hathaway and Robert DE Nero ."
"unlike their commonly popular roles , they both play good guys and very nicely ."

Gets the Job Done Robbie K back again with another movie review.
This time I'll be focusing on the latest Comedy entitled the Intern starring Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway.
"These two actors are legends for bringing roles to life, and from the trailers promise to bring their talents back to the silver screen for a heartwarming adventure."
Does this movie live up to that promise?
As always please read on to find out.
The story of the Intern is a simple tale about two lost people in need of something to help get their lives back on track.
"It's plot is very formulaic, lacking any twists or turns to offset the predictable path it follows."
"Both characters backgrounds are very typical of Nancy Meyers' work involving some unbalanced, dramatic family dynamic that is in need of some tuning up."
"Despite the familiar plot dynamic, The Intern somehow stands out from the mire of comedies that currently flood the market."
"For one, the movie is very relatable and realistic, with characters you latch on to within twenty minutes of the film's start."
"Ben (De Niro) and Jules (Hathaway) are characters who have morals and qualities fans of all ages will love, such as diligence, compassion, and rationality that many comedy/drama characters lack."
"And for once I wasn't annoyed by characters in a comedy/drama, but rather interested in seeing where their stories would go."
"In addition, the story kept taking different avenues, mixing up the drama to provide different obstacles for our characters to overcome (much like life), keeping things fresh."
"The major flaws with this story are small gaps that arise in the plot, things conveniently being settled at a drop of the hat, and some transitions that were a bit to random for me."
"But while the story is not the most unique, or exciting for that matter, The Intern does provide a handful of life lessons wrapped in a heart string tugging package."
"Ben's morals are motivating, traditional values from a dying generation that are designed to motivate and inspire one to work hard and help others."
"Jules characteristics are meant to be empowering, breaking the traditional stay at home mom role and portraying women kicking modern day business in the can."
"While these morals may seem cheesy, and overdone, Meyers manages to deliver them in a very appropriate manner that bypasses the preachy, in your face lessons."
"Even the romantic dilemmas are professionally portrayed, bypassing the movie magic and instead giving a realistic approach as to how to handle problems."
"Perhaps the biggest, unrealistic component is the fact that everyone actually listened to them without much resistance, seeing as humans are so open for taking advice these days."
"No matter how well a character is designed though, you need an actor to bring it to life, which this assembled cast more than accomplishes."
"De Niro continues his impressive track record, somehow playing epic characters, yet somehow playing himself."
"He brings that warm smile that brings confidence and wisdom, no matter the situation."
"Hathaway as well impressed me, as she wears the multiple hats of boss, friend, mother, and wife."
She covers the emotional spectrum and manages to sell the pain and pressure that Jules suffers from.
"Separate these two are strong, but when acting together they are on an even higher level of quality."
"The supporting cast is fantastic as well, each well balanced into the grand story to play their parts and provide the laughs we so need."
"Speaking of laughs, the Intern's comedy was a nice break from the overacted and ridiculously stupid stunts many comedies take these days."
"Instead it is witty, loaded with clever dialogue that is well timed and simplistic and for once not over done or drawn out in length."
"It branches across the age generations covering topics like love, balancing life with career, morals between old and new generations and bridging the technology gap."
"Each of these topics was tastefully done, relying on the actor's delivery to be funny instead of just some stupid catchphrase meant to be posted on memes."
"The Intern is not the most unique movie to grace the theaters, and it feels very much like a typical Nancy Meyer's work."
"However, this movie throws at a lot of the movie magic and melodramatic drama for a film that is fun, positive, and a good bridge across generation gaps."
"The little family established in this picture will pull you into movie, and the two hours will fly by as you become engrossed in the characters' lives."
"For quality acting and a fun movie, The Intern is worth a trip to the theater, despite it's lacking of special effects."
I encourage many to check it out when it comes out on Netflix or RedBox in the future.
My scores for the Intern are: Comedy: 8.0 Movie Overall: 8.0
"Heart Warming The emotional heart melting drama starred by actor Robert De Niro (as 70 years old, Ben The senior intern) and actress Anne Hathaway (as Ben's boss, Jules)."
Do not expect me that will say this is a love story crap between two of them.
This movie is far from that.
"It is about how an old intern, Ben changes the life of the hardworking & workaholic, Jules together with some emotional drama."
I hate to say this but this movie made my eyes to tear for few scenes.
1 star Two things struck me about this film as awful.
"First, for such a huge budget film, did they really have to play the same music over and over and over and over and over again?"
Wasn't there funding to find someone with a sense of artistry to select better music or at least a wider variety of sounds?
"Second, the writing was awful and the dialog was idiotic."
Wasn't the least bit interested in either of the two lead characters.
"I would have left before it ended, but we paid full price and I am an optimist: I kept expecting it to get better."
It didn't.
"On the plus side, the sets and wardrobe were nice."

"A delightful feel-good movie With main actors like Renee Russo and Robert de Niro of the older generation and Anne Hathaway of the younger, supported by a wealth of good actors like Anders Holm, Andrew Rannells, Adam Devine, Zack Perlman, and Christina Scherer (to mention a few) it is not surprising that this film is so good as it is!"
Director/writer Nancy Meyers have again made a memorable movie!
What's it about?
"Well, to quote the synopsis:

""A retired 70-year-old widower is bored with retired life."
"The founder of the company is Jules Ostin, a tireless, driven, demanding, dynamic workaholic."
"Ben is made her intern, but this is a nominal role - she doesn't intend to give him work and it is just window dressing."""
"But a lot of things do happen, sad, funny, and very realistic!"
"A great movie, by a great ensemble and a great director/writer."
"Oh, I liked the cinematography, too.Steven Goldblatt was the man behind the camera ‚Äî for once not a lot of shaky camera work, very rare today!"
"The Intern: A Delightful and Heartwarming Film That Hits All the Right Notes ""The Intern"" is an absolute gem of a movie that effortlessly combines entertainment, laughter, and a heartwarming story."
"From start to finish, this film kept me thoroughly engaged, leaving me with a smile on my face long after the credits rolled."
Nancy Meyers masterfully crafts a delightful tale that beautifully captures the essence of human connection and the power of intergenerational relationships.
One of the standout aspects of the film is the exceptional performances by Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway.
"De Niro's portrayal of Ben Whittaker, a 70-year-old widower taking on an internship, is nothing short of brilliant."
"He brings a charming blend of wisdom, humor, and vulnerability to the character, making Ben an endearing and relatable presence."
"Hathaway delivers a captivating performance as Jules Ostin, the young and driven CEO."
"Her portrayal perfectly balances the complexities of a woman navigating both personal and professional challenges, drawing viewers into her journey with authenticity and grace."
The chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway is undeniable.
"Their on-screen dynamic is a joy to watch, as they develop a genuine friendship that transcends generational boundaries."
"Their interactions are filled with witty banter, genuine moments of vulnerability, and mutual growth."
It's a testament to the talent of both actors that they effortlessly bring these characters to life and make their connection feel authentic and heartfelt.
"What sets ""The Intern"" apart is its ability to tackle important themes with a light touch."
"The film explores the value of experience, the need for work-life balance, and the struggles faced by women in positions of power."
"It does so with nuance and sensitivity, weaving these issues seamlessly into the narrative."
"In addition to its strong performances and thought-provoking themes, ""The Intern"" boasts impeccable production design and a delightful soundtrack that complements the story perfectly."
"The film beautifully captures the vibrant energy of the workplace, juxtaposed with the quiet moments of introspection."
"Ultimately, ""The Intern"" is a feel-good movie that leaves you with a warm and fuzzy feeling."
It reminds us that age is just a number and that we can find purpose and fulfillment in unexpected places.
"It celebrates the power of friendship, the value of human connection, and the wisdom that comes with life experience."
"With its stellar performances, engaging storytelling, and uplifting message, ""The Intern"" is a must-watch for anyone seeking an entertaining and genuinely good-hearted film experience."
Doesn't practise what it preaches - and it preaches a lot Anne Hatherway has started her successful business from the ground up using a hand on management approach.
"She is forced to take a ""senior intern"" in the form of De Nero who she initially butts heads with, but soon they warm to one another."
This film has the potential to be warm and funny (it generally is) but is very preachy.
There are clumsy dialogues regarding prejudice and inequality that come out of nowhere.
"This film is even-handed if nothing else, if you are going to be beaten with the feminist stick then expect a battering with... whatever the opposite is."
"The worse thing about this film though is that it challenges the idea (we all apparently have) that old people are stupid, useless liabilities."
De Niro disproves this idea.
Yet all the jokes are based around how all the other older characters are ridiculous and incapable.
By the end I felt like I had sat through one of those awful mandatory HR training films.
I had been force fed a load of information I already knew with very little entertainment value.
"All that said, production is good, acting is good and this isn't a terrible watch - I just expected more laughs and less sermon."
I never get bored of this film This is one of those rare movies that simply works in every way imaginable.
"De Niro and Hathaway are both wonderful, and the support cast is perfect."
"I especially love how every one of the younger characters naturally gravitates to Ben (De Niro), and without him trying to convince anyone of anything, they all naturally tyr to emulate him."
"Starting over The Intern is an easy going, genial film."
Not laugh out funny and does not really has a lot to say apart from older people have skills and values that are worth something.
Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) is retired and on his own and wants something to do.
He gets a position as an intern at an online fashion start up that is doing very well.
Ben shadows the founder of the company Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) who is a workaholic and trying to balance work and family life.
She is reluctant to have Ben around seeing his as being too old but Ben perseveres.
Suddenly he is an asset to the other interns who find his life experience valuable and also to Jules who after her initial hesitation finds him someone she can rely on.
Writer/Director Nancy Meyers brings an assured touch for what is really an old fashioned story with a modern twist.
"De Niro is comfortable playing Gentle Ben, knocking about with the younger interns and he even gets romance sub plot."
"He has a spine of steel and there is the revelation that he is interning in a place where he used to work for many decades, an industry overtaken by IT."
"Anne Hathaway's character reminded me of a little too much of The Devil wears Prada, she was certainly a little too abrasive at first even discriminatory towards old people."
However once the film settles down it is amiable but does feel over- long and rather cloying by the end.
A pointless pile of fluffy feathers I suppose some Hollywood exec thought that by pairing one of the best actors of many generations with the always engaging and lovely Anne Hathaway would cover all the demographic bases and produce a solid moneymaker.
"Sadly, that wasn't the case and now this movie is stuck on both of their resumes as the sell-out movie that nobody cared about."
"De Niro is my favorite male actor too, and Hathaway one of my top fav female actors."
"So, I did enjoy watching the two work together but couldn't they have found a better script?"
This one was plain rubbish and the whole movie was just disgustingly pleasant and pointless the whole way through.
Everything in it's place and every day sunny.
Barf!
I can see why Hathaway took the movie though.
"Strong woman role and working with Bobbie D, no-brainer, but why would De Niro take it?"
Does he need the money?
"After such an illustrious career leading some of the greatest movies of all time, he decided it's time to play an Intern for an Internet startup company in a movie with no meaning whatsoever?"
It's truly a sad day for De Niro fans.
"Utterly charming if a little slow in places This is a really nice movie, and I mean that in a positive way."
"I was reminded how completely charming Anne Hathaway is, even if the premise had echoes of The Devil Wears Pravda."
"DeNiro is quiet and understated, so much so that you wonder if a Goodfellas moment is around the corner, but thankfully it's not."
"There could have been more about the other senior interns for something inside from comic relief, but otherwise a very watchable movie."
"Anne Hathaway is adorable in it, did I mention that?"

Boring and greatly indifferent film Not much to say about this Nancy Meyers new film.
Typical-boring HD photography and not much of a story going on.
Deniro plays a decent schmuck who got a job as a 70year old intern for a fashion company.
There is no substance.
"Anne Hathaway is supposed to be a very austere and multitasking Boss , yet a good and warm mother and person."
"OK , but in this film it isn't played out right, we don't care one bit."
Mainly its the script thats at fault.
It isn't a film that should have a spot on the map.
7.3 rating ?
Make that a 6.0 at best.
It's a film you look at while waiting at a dentist's office.
"I am into comedies and dramedies a lot , just not into bad films."
"Don't even watch this film , choose wiser."
"Sometimes reality check does not work, still an entertaining movie After watching the first third of this movie, I prepared to write a quite negative review about it."
"I wanted to say that obviously, noone from the writers crew has ever worked in a company: appointments are never sent per usual email; there is NO paper in an office of an e-commerce company; CEO of a company would never cry in a meeting, no matter if a woman or a man; chauffeur and personal secretary for a boss of a company with only few hundred staff members, seriously?"
"I can hardly imagine a guy as smart as Ben, being team lead for years and not able to switch on a computer; and last but not least, there are never so personal discussions in a working place, constantly addressing the feelings of everyone."
"However, after watching more of this film, its charm got more and more to me."
"The chemistry between the main characters is great, it is well acted and the story became even more moving."
Still the ending bothered me somehow - does someone find it truly realistic that Jules' husband suddenly realizes how wrong his behaviour was and all his feelings leading to this behaviour disappear?
And that Jule will feel good from now on coming home late and knowing her husband is spending a lot of time with the ladies where he found his affair previously?
"Nevertheless, still this movie is fun to watch (it has some really good jokes), entertaining and made with love."
I also found its message about empowering women very appealing and topical.
"I would recommend it, if you don't want to take it too seriously."
I honestly liked this movie!
The first time I watched it I didn't really think I would enjoy it but now I find myself going back to it and rewatching it.
"It's nice to see the friendship between the characters grow as the movie progresses, it had wholesome vibes."
The actors and team did a good job with this movie!
"A real warmth There's lots of films that are light hearted and romantic and have this sort of feel , but not usually with this mix ."
It really does have a real warmth with unusually characters that are all likeable and get even more so .
You will end up with a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye .
"It's not trying to change the world just maybe think a bit more about who you meet

"I was watching it with wide open eyes and big smile So much to take from this movie, so much to learn, so much to smile about, cry and get your heart warm."
"Thank you for this, truly amazing movie."
Such a new and unique scenario!
So fresh and lovely) So much emotions!
I really wanted to enjoy this movie but it lacks strong emotions Movie is following the story of a senior (Robert De Niro) who applies to work as an intern in an internet startup company which is run by Jules (Anne Hathaway).
"""The Intern"" is something of a generational back- flip on ""The Devil Wears Prada""."
Basically a generation gap drama-comedy with so many half-formed characters and a sense that it runs too long.
"This film proves how political correctness can damage a movie - everyone is so psychotically pleasant, not to mention Jules stay-at-home husband and an adorable daughter in addition to a stimulating career."
"Also, I haven't seen Robert De Niro play such a likable character in a very long time which here feels like he is lifeless."
"All of this makes ""The Intern"" a bland movie."
"""The Intern"" has it's finger on the pulse of young and old, but the heartbeat is the thing it fails to detect."
"It's not an unpleasant way to spend some time, but movie is so forgettable because its desperately trying to be sweet, but actually is corny."
Rating: 5+/6-
I sooooooo love this movie Seriously it's awesome.
I wish they didn't make you do ten lines on here because I can say it in less.
I wish that I could work here.
"It's relaxed it's fun, the boss is totally cool, it's modern and open minded."
Really seems like perfect place to work.
I've always liked Anne Hathaway no matter what others say so I really think they chose the perfect person for this role.
What a totally relaxing and unusual movie for this time period.
Everything needed like the old classic.
I will be watching again.
"This is recommended for ""Anne Hathaway"" lovers."
What a lovely movie to spend your afternoon watching it !
"It has the perfect mixture of comedy ""not for laughing out loud though"", sensations, good writing, ""Anne Hathaway"" different face expressions, ""Robert De Niro"" warm acting, and of course a good dose of drama especially in the last thirty minutes of the movie."
"The movie follows multiple line of actions, one of ""Robert De Niro"" that shows us a good background about his character, and another one about ""Anne Hathaway"" that shows up her multiple layers continuously throughout the movie, and of course both of them meet up together to start the plot of the movie."
"Finally, it's a light comedy drama movie with a genuine idea that was well represented with that group of actors, and of course it can get you out of a bad mood."
"Feel good movie with few business lessons When we started watching, we were not sure, if we would enjoy this movie, but slowly got pulled into it with different characters in the movie and their acting."
"Needless to say, acting and expressions of Robert De Niro & Anne Hathaway was too good."
"Need to thank the director for giving us the glimpse into how online fashion startups work, so learnt a business lesson there."
"Overall, it's a perfect Saturday night movie!"
"Only thing they could have improved is, movie was rather predictable, so audience could easily guess, what's coming up!"
"Great dialogue The screenplay is excellent, as are the actors."
"I love how Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway play, and Renee Russo comes as a bonus."
"It's not Fellini, but the truth is that I enjoyed every second of it."
"I was very charmed by this Ben(Robert De Niro) a 70 year old retiree, who was been a widower for three years, feels he is missing a little bit of things in life."
So Ben takes a job has an intern for a fashion company.
"And everybody seems to love him there, but will his uptight boss named Jules(Anne Hathaway) ever grow to like him?"
"This movie surprised me in many ways, De Niro and Hathaway have quite a great pairing."
"The film plays against so many movie clich√©s, just when you think it's gonna go one way, then it really surprises you."
All the other cast are pretty good also.
"If you want a movie that so light on it's feet, then The Intern is that movie for you."
And Anne Hathaway gives quite a good performance that is Oscar worthy.
It's also nice to see De Niro be very light also.

"The truth is... something about you makes me feel calm, or more centered, or something.'"
Now and then a movie comes along that instead of polarizing senior citizens against the younger Internet media obsessed generation elects to show how mutually beneficial the two ends of the age spectrum can be.
"And that is what Nancy Meyers (The Intern, It's Complicated, The Holiday, Something's Gotta Give, The Parent Trap, Father of the Bride, etc) has accomplished with aplomb in writing and directing this very fine little comedy with strong philosophical overtones."
The fact that she is working with a cast of impeccable actors adds to the pleasure and meaning of this very fine little film.
But in the long run it is the mutual respect for the two ends of the age divide that makes this a true 'comedy' rather that a mocking spoof.
70-year-old widower Ben Whittaker Robert De Niro) has discovered that retirement isn't all it's cracked up to be.
"Seizing an opportunity to get back in the game, he becomes a senior intern at an online fashion site, founded and run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) ‚Äì a true barnstormer of a creative personality obsessed with her success of her start up business."
"Jules is married to a stay at home dad (Anders Holm) and has a spunky child, but her work seems to take precedence ‚Äì until the concept of a senior intern is forced upon her."
Gradually the two come together in the most respectful and endearing way and form a heartfelt partnership that both need.
"The supporting cast - Rene Russo (the office masseuse), Andrew Rannells, Adam DeVine, Zach Pearlman, Jason Orley, Christina Scherer, Nat Wolff, Celia Weston et al ‚Äì is to the person terrific."
"Played with a fine pacing and more information about Internet marketing than any book can offer, this is not only entertaining but a learning experience."
Hathaway and De Niro are magic together.
Awful describes it very well The most unoriginal movie I've seen this year.
So poorly written it made me wanna leave the theater multiple times.
A story about an unusual intern/assistant that is not expected to do a good job but then turns out to be helpful and wanted??
Really??
Because nobody watched The Devil Wears Prada.
"It does embrace some other topics (in an effort to make it seem less of a copy) such as the 'working mom', 'stay home dad', 'oldie-but-goodie' - but in such a trivial way."
It adds nothing to the matters.
"Anne's character is too apologetic, some characters seem to be calling the shots but then they just disappear."
It's not an absolute waste of time because there are some (very little) funny moments.
But even that shouldn't be a reason to watch it.
I kept rolling my eyes.
It underestimates your intelligence.
"Long, Pedestrian Cheese Nancy Meyers is one of the most successful female writers/directors/producers in Hollywood."
That's great because they have a major shortage of them.
"However, Nancy Meyers is also one of the most pedestrian writers/producers/directors in Hollywood."
"Her films always follow the same trajectory and have the same ""insert clich√© here"" templates."
They are very predictable and hardly challenging.
"""The Intern"" is proof of this, a film that has many good messages, but is written with so much cheese and fluff that it would have fit better on The Hallmark Channel than as a major studio picture."
"The movie stars Anne Hathaway as Jules Ostin, the CEO/Founder of a fast growing Internet Shopping company in New York City."
"Jules is very much ""work focused"" and has zero balance in her life."
"Her company, About the Fit, starts a senior intern program."
"Why, probably something to do with appearing ""not agiest"" but we are never given any explanation for this."
"Seventy year old Ben Whittaker (Robert DeNiro) is a bored, retired widower."
"He applies for the intern position and gets it, having to help Jules with her day-to-day business."
"The movie has great messages of successful women in the workplace, seniors still have wisdom to impart to young adults, and that men and women can have plutonic friendships without love or sex."
"However, the sloppy screen writing takes these messages and covers them with cheese and clich√©s."
"The company is the stereotypical company of today: loaded with hipsters, the office looking like a loft, people dressed casually, etc."
"The movie is loaded with product placement from Apple, Audi, Samsung, Stella Artois, etc."
Ben and Jules have no real conflicts or disagreements.
The two have too smooth of a relationship.
The conflicts feel more manufactured to fill the two hour time frame.
It should have been cut down to 80-90 minutes.
The characters are one dimensional and flat.
"Even in the end, when the true conflict finally does happen, it wraps itself up too easily and comes across disappointing that it doesn't go in another direction, especially with the ""successful woman"" mantra the film tries to illustrate."
It would have been nice if DeNiro's Ben had some flaws or shortcomings that Jules could have seen as well as all the great qualities as well.
You learn from both things in most friendships.
It also would have been nice if Jules had to make some hard decisions or sacrifices to grow her business.
"In the end, she doesn't, and it continues that message of you can have it all, which most of the time, you can't, but I guess you can in the movies...

No, it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, and there were some good scenes here and there, some small laughs, but very paint by the numbers in many ways."
"I like the messages, but I think there's a way to get them across better without beating the audience over the head and dumbing down the material."
"The generation gap, sociological commentary, and great narrative structure all in one film Ben Whitaker (Robert De Niro) is a retired man in his seventies, working for a phonebook company for decades and as a marketer for a larger firm."
"His talents and old-fashioned state of mind kept him employed for many years, and though he has found retirement relaxing and mentally freeing, he is still antsy in his every day life."
"He wants to do something big, but can't figure out what that something should be."
"He decides to apply on a whim for a senior internship program at About the Fit, an e-commerce fashion company run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway)."
"Upon getting the job, he accepts a position as the intern for Jules, even though she states that she will have little for him to do."
"As a result, Ben begins helping around the office and eventually catches the eye of Jules, who notices his outgoing, selfless personality, his gentlemanly ways, and his talents as an everyman."
"With that, Jules begins using him as her driver and an assistant scheduler, but despite this, Jules is juggling an immense amount of responsibilities."
"Her company has hit its five-year-growth-plan in a matter of nine months, and even with a staff of two-hundred and twenty people, they are struggling to keep up with orders and hold on to this exponential productivity and growth."
"Jules, who is also a wife and mother of a young girl, is told by one of her assistant mangers that they are thinking of bringing in a CEO to help Jules make managerial decisions and run the company, something she fears will rob her company of its core ideology and grassroots plan."
"Stressed and out of options, Jules utilizes Ben's versatile traits to help her in a time of need, and the two strike an amiable chemistry."
"Nancy Meyers's ""The Intern"" ranks up alongside Noah Baumbach's ""While We're Young"" for one of the year's strongest comedy-dramas, and it's interesting to note how both films pose telling insights as they portray the post-World War II/baby boomer crowd clashing with the millennial generation."
"Ben's choice to dress dapper, even for a casual job, in addition to his age-old wisdom are thing that startles the youngbloods who work at About the Fit, and even his ideas throw the young crowd for a loop."
His refreshing honesty and common sense approaches to conflicts are something a generation raised on the impersonal communication devices of email and Twitter find so preposterous that they're brilliant.
"Instead of portraying the newer generation as stupid and incompetent, writer/directress Meyers shows them as people victim to convenience instead of directness."
"With that, the thoughtful, sociological examination of men and women here is something I didn't expect with this film."
"Consider the scene in a bar, which has been shortened to the scene of Jules questioning her employees about how, in the span of one generation, men have gone from guys like Jack Nicholson and Harrison Ford to ""boys,"" as she puts it, in the trailer."
"I found the scene trivial and grating in the trailer, because the same argument could be made for women in a different light, but upon seeing the entire film, or the entire scene for that matter, Jules brings up an interesting observation about men and women in the current generation."
"Jules states how women have been nurtured and taught (not coddled) to be empowered and determined to strive above society's gender roles, which is why you see women starting companies, becoming the breadwinners, and proving they are more than submissive housewives."
"In the process, she asserts, men have lost the kind of individualist determination of fitting into the box of masculinity, which is why you are seeing more men do things like playing video games and accepting less laborious forms of work."
"They were the ones previously schooled to believe in hard work and leadership, but seeing that role shifted has allegedly created a new contrast."
"Agree or disagree, or contemplate it, as I have been, this is a profoundly big concept for mainstream Hollywood film to make and this idea is carried through the film in a way that's not condescending, but enlightening."
"Even take it a step back and look at Robert De Niro, an actor who was said to have lost his way in the early 2000's with easier, less compelling roles, only to rise and accept a whole new breed of roles in films like ""Silver Linings Playbook."""
"Now look at Anne Hathaway, a rising star in the 2000's who subsequently found a way to fade from the public eye, perhaps showing the contrasting longevity of an actress to an actor."
"It goes without saying that their performances and chemistry here is simply remarkable, as Meyers predicates it off emotionally honest conversations."
"Finally, Meyers structures the film in a way that has its focus shift from being very broad to very specific by the latter half of the narrative."
"In the beginning, we see the grandscale setting of the About the Fit office and all its employees, before slowly but surely settling into focus on the two lead actors in a seamless manner."
This smooth concentration allows for a nice narrative shift that doesn't make for jarring unevenness and it's something that editor Robert Leighton will get far less credit for than he deserves.
"""The Intern"" is a pleasant surprise for a drama, as many dramas boasting big actors fail to impress and audiences are left with the optimism that independent films will pick up their slack."
"It's truly amazing to see a mainstream film tackle so much in the way of the generation gap, sociological commentary, and strong narrative structure in a film as unassuming as this."
"Minimize the level of outrageous situational humor (which, despite being a bit strangely placed - the scene with the email specifically - does indeed work) and this film could easily something Alexander Payne would make."
Suppose it DOES work ...
I consider this movie to be an example of flicks that our society needs these days.
Although the characters in this movie naturally are confronted with setbacks and disappointment they deal with it in a positive way without being confronted with hell on earth and being over dramatic.
"It encourages the believe: ""Suppose it DOES work ...""."
Have fun!
My Review!
One of the most beautiful simple story movies ever.
Loved the classic role of Robert De Niro.
A family kinda movie.
Do watch it.

Great great movie Absolutely worth watching fun movie has an incredible story De niro is great And Hathaway proves she is more than capable to hold her own with the greats.
"Amusing but not hilarious; tries to be relevant, but unfocused ""The Intern"" is amusing, but seldom funny; pleasant, but seldom engaging; thoughtful, but not cathartic."
"It toys with a lot of liberal, socially relevant issues without presenting any concrete ideas in a convincing manner."
It attempts to be a romantic comedy without being a romantic comedy.
"The idea that is given the most attention is that older, experienced individuals still have a lot to contribute in the workforce."
"Robert De Niro plays Ben, a retired production and marketing executive who worked in an obsolete industry and who is considered obsolete himself due to his age."
"But he's highly intelligent, experienced, wise, cautious, persuasive, somewhat charismatic, astute, etc., etc., etc., and has a lot to offer to Anne Hathaway's Jules, a hard-driven entrepreneur who is in over her head as a victim of her own success."
"Ben eventually proves himself invaluable to the company and, as the consummate team player, helps to spotlight the overlooked talents of Jules's assistant and three other interns."
His reward is apparently for Jules to decide she wants to keep him on as an unpaid intern.
She never demonstrates her character's growth by effectively utilizing all the talent available to her and instead continues her commitment to principles of micromanagement.
"The film presents numerous other notions, including the Horatio Alger notion that if you listen to your customers and give them what you want, you will reap immense rewards, and Polonius's advice to be true to yourself."
Nothing is so broken that it can't be fixed and nothing is so fixed that it can't be improved.
A woman can be successful in business and still be a wife and mother.
"It has nearly as many homilies as ""Poor Richard's Almanac."""
Jules must overcome various challenges.
One central challenge is from the venture capitalists who want her to hire an experienced CEO to run the company.
These are the guys who control her purse strings.
She needs to invest in warehouses and computer systems and personnel.
These guys have pumped tens of millions of dollars into her business and she needs more money to keep it running.
But they are worried about their money.
"If she rejects their advice, they could limit her access to funds."
But we don't see the consequences of her decision.
Is she able to convince the bankers of her way of thinking?
"At another point, she has to confront several simultaneous disasters, including a product recall and a major systems bug."
"Rather than concentrate her attention on the problems at the office, she is distracted by a personal disaster and wants to reassign her systems staff to solving it, which is a major conflict of interest and would certainly shatter the venture capitalists' confidence in her."
"Ben comes to the rescue with an unconventional solution which leads to an amusing scene, but it means the talent she needs to learn to draw upon is taken out of the equation and we never learn how she handled the simultaneous disasters."
The film feels like it wants to be a romantic comedy and has several trappings of such.
There is a bromance between Ben and the other interns.
"There's a romantic subplot between Ben, played by De Niro (68), who is pursued by Patty (Linda Lavin (78)), but hooks up with Fiona (Rene Russo (61))."
The subplot adds nothing to the story and seems to be there only as an excuse to avoid any romance between Ben and Jules (Hathaway (33)).
"Meanwhile, Jules's stay-at-home husband has a dalliance with a girl who has about as much screen presence as Suzanne Somers in ""American Graffitti."""
"An office romance between two supporting characters also adds little in terms of plot, character or humor."
It seems as if something more could have been done with the romantic subplots.
"Matt's inamorata could have been fleshed out to give Jules some actual competition, raise the stakes and require her to develop as a person to overcome the challenge."
"With so much to say about office policies, the film has nothing to say about the two office romances."
Ben dumping the cougar for a younger woman is vaguely amusing.
They could have pushed the envelope a little with Jules pursuing a measure of revenge on Matt through a liaison with Ben.
Ben's character seems a bit contrived.
"He recently retired from a successful career, but seems to know next to nothing about computers."
"His friends are dropping like flies, but he is in excellent health."
"Overall, it's a pleasant film that seems a little unfocused."
"There are numerous socially relevant topics, but none are developed satisfactorily."
"It tries to be funny, but also tries to be serious."
"Good performances, particularly by De Niro and Hathaway."
"Successful, sweetly observed comedy from Nancy Meyers STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

Ben Whitaker (Robert De Niro) is a seventy year old widower from New York, who answers a job vacancy for a senior intern at an online fashion agency, run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), in order to give some direction and meaning back to his life."
"At first, he couldn't look more out of place in the modern open plan, tech savvy work place he now occupies, but his old school ways eventually endear him to his co workers, as well as Jules herself, until Ben becomes her driver and she finds his age and wisdom coming to save her in her personal as well as professional life."
"The pace of technology over the course of the last forty to fifty years has accelerated to the point that the modern world resembles something of a science fiction movie come to life, and one in which the older generation would understandably feel quite bewildered and overwhelmed by, and this is the inspired premise that Nora Ephron chooses to explore in this gentle, bittersweet comedy, that eschews an old fashioned charm that isn't to be found in many films of the genre these days."
"In the lead role, De Niro excels as the kindly old widow with advise and wisdom to dispense in droves, in a role with similarities with, but a complete contrast to, his role in the execrable Dirty Grandpa, which actually followed this."
"While he seemed totally out of place and degraded in that film, this is a part he fits much more comfortably, which suits his personality and talents a lot better, allowing him to create some genuinely decent chemistry with co star Hathaway and the rest of the youthful cast, which works wonders."
"By creating a genuinely inspired concept and not just nose diving for cheap laughs and crudeness, it's paid off for Ephron and she's created a hugely rewarding and successful comedy that will manage to generate equal appeal to audiences young and old alike."
"Great Movie, a relaxing watch 5 October 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Intern."
A lovely lovely film.
"I'm am a fan of Anne Hathaway but not so much Robert De Niro, so I decided to give this film a try, so glad I did."
"It's one of those feel good movies which amble along at a gentle speed, fairly predictable but the storyline meanders enough to keep you interested."
Hathaway brings her usual quirkiness to the character and De Niro plays a wonderful father figure with the most expansive array of facial expressions which brings lightness and comedy to the film.
The addition of Rene Russo as Fiona the In House masseuse was fab.
A very relaxing story to watch which left me feeling I'd not wasted the last couple of hours.
One of those films you could watch again and again and still enjoy.
"Great acting and an original plot It's so nice to have a comedy about older people without it revolving around the getting old, but instead on how others can view you as ""old"", which this movie depicts with great flair."
The acting by both DeNiro and Hathaway is super and one of the biggest reasons this movie is so fun to watch.
"The character played by DeNiro seems a bit too flawless to be overall believable, but he's charming enough to get away with it."
"It sometimes becomes a bit too sappy where it could have been funnier, but it remains a good movie to watch!"
Really a sweet movie with real life troubles Talks about some of the main issues in the world out there.

Lame Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
What happened to the world?
Is this only USA problem?
I have been reading several reviews here.
And many people gave this movie a very good note.
And even sometimes very complex reviews.
There is NOTHING complex about this movie.
"Sure, Robert de Niro is Robert de Niro."
And I must say the scenario is less horrible than the one of It's complicated.
"But boy, Nancy Meyers knows how to write a commercial movie."
"Take the assistants, there is nothing less accurate than how they talk."
Anne Hataway seems to have found back the acting of her Disney years.
Nothing true perspires from that.
This movie reminds me of Meg Ryan's best years.
A good way to not think.
"Yes, the movie talks about real interesting issues."
"But it turns them into an over-egged pudding, just like Hollywood does."
"And yes, it is watchable."
"The same way an ice cream is eatable, a cigarette is smokable and a whiskey is drinkable."
May not be healthy but tasty.
Now I don't wanna sound too negative.
"That is why I offer to leave you with titles of movies I find are a healthy way to use 2 hours with :


Yi-Yi, a One and a Two



Trois couleurs : Bleu



Burnt by the sun



La Maman et La Putain


and maybe you wanna laugh, so :


The Meaning of Life



The Invention of Lying



Les Bronz√©s."
That's it man.
Please stop feeding us this low-quality entertainment.
"I was hooked from beginning to end Maybe it's a commercial, but so what?"
It's a win-win!
"The movie staff got paid, the brands got promoted and we the audience have a wonderful story to watch!"
We shouldn't feel SO obliged to be 100% critical and extremely negative all the time!
"The Handkerchief OK, I'll try to be short and sweet, because there are many other reviews at this point (107/108, somewhere around there), so I'll just give you my pros and cons about the story, and also how some of the other reviewers missed things in the movie (in my opinion)."
"First of all; why The Handkerchief, instead of the real title?"
"Because it isn't as much about the intern Ben Wittacker himself (Robert DeNiro), as it is more about Jules Ostin (Anne Hatheway), and the role of men and women in modern society."
"The handkerchief is a symbol of lost values which Ben reintroduces with a younger generation, along with other (little) things."
"Pivotal in this was the scene in the bar where Jules makes the observation that girls become women, but somewhere along the line men became boys."
This sums the problem men face in today's society.
"Furthermore; the relation between Ben and Jules; from scene one it was clear that Ben wouldn't do much growing, or have a huge story-arc in this movie; he was the mentor for the group of people from the get go."
"The real growing was done by Jules (and in lesser part by the staff surrounding her), but this part was the most disappointing for me because (SPOILER AHEAD) she forgave her husband for cheating on her (bullshit about feeling emasculated and so on)."
"I hoped that she had found the confidence and power to kick his sorry b-hind to the curb, because she and her daughter would be fine without him (being her daughter being almost a carbon copy of her)."
(END OF SPOILER).
Was the execution flawless?
"No, it had it's minor difficulties, such as a weird break-in scene, and the thing mentioned above was for me such a big thing that I subtracted two points instead of one for the little things."
"So, here's my two cents, see what you do with it."
"Pleasant The Intern is like a mild salsa: filling, healthy and satisfying without a whole lot of flavor or fear of heartburn."
"Luckily, that potential blandness is rendered effective through some gentle melancholy, soft humor, and genuinely entertaining performances throughout."
"Instead of another shallow dramedy, we're presented with properly complex adult issues, like aging, loneliness, marriage, and career, told with sincerity and a healthy amount of Hollywood heart."
The tone can be summed up in one word: cute.
"Sure, it's a comedy, but its jokes don't really inspire uproarious guffaws as much as they do crooked, polite grins."
"This isn't an altogether bad thing, as we watch the blossoming friendship between distraught internet mogul Hathaway and her aged apprentice, De Niro."
"Their relationship at times feels a bit forced, overly quirky and predictable."
"While this renders the movie a little long (2 SOLID hours), the centering presence of the surprisingly likable De Niro pushes this above your average PG-13 comedy."
"Director Meyers has always made movies whose highest aspiration seems to be ""pleasantness"" (The Holiday, The Parent Trap)."
"Up until now, I've yet to find her slight brand of grown-up humor appealing."
"The Intern isn't much different in spirit, yet somehow it works."
"Sure, it was a bit awkward at times, like a person acting too young for their age, but along with the gentle jokes and personal drama, there are actually some nice visual flourishes in the crisp editing and directing."
"Much like last month's pop hit, The Intern's inoffensive brand of entertainment will fall right off your brain when you leave, yet be catchy and familiar enough to divert you during its runtime."
"Had High Hopes I really had high hopes for this movie, based solely on the cast and director/writer."
Unfortunately...meh.
Somewhere along the way they forgot they needed a plot rather than a meandering set of vignettes and half-baked sub-plots.
"All of which get tied up neatly in 30 seconds at the end, leaving everyone exactly where they started."
"It's almost as if on one of the days of shooting someone said, ""We've got enough footage: let's see if we can edit this into a decent movie."""
They couldn't.
"Hathaway and DeNiro are, of course, excellent."
It's just unfortunate they don't have anything really solid to be excellent at in this semi-coherent storyline.
"Some of the secondary actors really shine, too."
France called.
They want their cheese back ¬¨¬¨ I agreed to watch this movie because I was in a chill out mood and I didn't want to watch anything that made me think too much or that required much attention.
"Well, this movie succeeded with honors at the task."
"If you are up to pay for high class actors' vacations, then this is the movie for you."
"If you are all about getting money taken out of your pocket for the sake of it, then this is your movie."
"If you are up to see an interesting drama, possibly well developed scripts and characters and actors at their very best... Well I'm sorry to be the one to disappoint you, but this is not the movie you are looking for."
"Absolute nonsense and poorly developed scripts, big companies propaganda (Apple, Facebook, ...), bad acting (even for those big names), dialogs so cheesy that would make a Parisian's stomach roar in hunger."
Watch it if you don't mind having your intelligence neglected by the best marketing strategists in Hollywood.
Could Only Watch 10 minutes This was on HBO's so I watched.
I had seen the trailer and it looked cute and a premise I'd never seen before.
I could not watch more than 10 minutes of this movie.
"Maybe that is not giving it a fair shot, but my 10 minute rule has never failed me."
If the first 10 suck the rest will most certainly be worse or way worse.In the 10 minutes I did manage to stomach I was embarrassed over the absurd rudeness of Hathaway's character.
"If the company decided to have this ""intern program"" she could at least pretend to be on board with it."
Instead she is ageist and insulting and IMO not convincing.
Amanda Priestly she is not.
Even though Amanda Priestly was a cold hearted bitch at least she was an entertaining one.
It just came across as false to me.
The whole exaggerated idea that young people know everything while older people know nothing was also an insult and just wrong.
Sure younger people are more in touch and in tune with technology all that is new...but older people provided they are healthy can be just as aware.
"Also the background music was completely annoying and reminded me of a bad 80's movie
4 out of 8 found this helpful."
I wanted so much more The premise is excellent.
It did not wind up where I thought it would.
I did not expect DeNiro to get the girl.
"And he did not, that is, not as a lover or wife."
"But, the movie went nowhere."
It basically ended exactly where it began.
"That is, a successful entrepreneur female with a husband who has an affair and is rattled by her busy life finds a part of her life instilled with peace and balance by a father figure of Bob DeNiro."
The movie ends up the same in the end except that DeNiro (Ben) is now a part of their lives and has come to add a much needed father figure status to Hathaway's existence.
"What I had hoped for is a few twists, maybe some laughs, and perhaps some inventive rewarding plot developments."
There was none of those things.
The script is dead.
"The actors and the production itself is first class, A category, and very well produced overall, except for the lack of a great script."
This is a nice script.
This is a movie for a Saturday afternoon when you feel like just relaxing in and not thinking about a lot.
Maybe that is enough.
"Imagine if Ian Fleming's Goldfinger in 1964 was produced as it was, but the script only developing James' character, and showed no real plot or action."
"Maybe if Goldfinger was never encountered, there were no chase scenes, and Oddjob did not chase Bond all over the movie set."
Just a snapshot production of the life of a secret agent.
"The girls, the bars, some of the gadgets, but no story."
Kind of the same thing here.
What COULD have been done?
I never wanted DeNiro to get the girl or have an affair.
"I did expect him to be the in name only CEO of the company, and I imagine some funny situations could have been made when Ben attempts to fool the investors that he is in charge and experienced in fashion enough to safely direct the company."
"He could have accidentally produced a new fashion, or killed off an existing one."
He could have stumbled into a genius success at being a CEO while not bumping off the protagonist.
"Imagine if the founder was not around and not reachable, and some important decisions had to be made."
Imagine if he accidentally made the right ones.
You get the idea.
This is not a comedy.
This is a mug of hot chocolate.
It is a cross between a drama and a romance.
"I am convinced if Robert DeNiro had not played the lead, this film would have flopped and gone nowhere."
I think the movie betrays the audience.
They expected more.
I think a Carol Burnett class of comedy writers should have been brought in to give this script the shot in the arm it needed.
One of the worst and longest agonizing movies ever I watched the whole thing!
My bad.
I was hoping it would get better at some point but it just dragged on and on and on endlessly.
Robert DeNiro deserves the worst actor category of 2015 and Hathaway is not far behind.
However watching DeNiro is just embarrassing.
Having gone from one of the best actors in film to possibly the worst is just hard for a movie fan to take.
Can't he just retire with some dignity?
Does he have to made a fool of himself with all the trash he appears in lately?
Does he need money that badly?
"We should all have a charity fund for him rather than watch him become a grade ""B"" (no make that a grade ""F"") actor."
It's hard to watch!

"This is great, coz its simple No cheesy moments, no extra complexity, no flashy sets, no crappy lines...... two of the best people telling us to smile and relax while they r doing what they r best at."
This movie works because its simple without the flashy n shallow stuff we see these days.
"The concept is really nice, unlike the previous intern movies this is put in the best way with a refreshing breath by the writers."
Shows how success brings about changes hard to comprehend and also how old life also need craving of new.
Loved every last bit of it.
Niro at its recent best.
Hathaway moving as always.
loved it & want more like it.
PS: take a note directors.

schmaltz This is the classic ann hathaway schmaltzy movie.
it is very cliche in every way.
the movie is saved by the odd comedy mostly --the other interns.
very unbelievable movie.
ann hathaway as a business genius is a huge stretch.
Imagne going through life without having read Shakespeare or Martin Buber People make disasters out of their life.
It is a rule of life.
It is inevitable.
That's why these people consult others who have read Shakespeare and Martin Buber--they are the ones who clarify for the confused.
Jules Ostin --Anne Hathaway-- is 32 year old dot com entrepreneur; one of her assistants has suggested a senior intern program for retired employees--enter Ben Witaker--age 70 --Robert De Niro.
"I found the movie warm, endearing, charming; a sleeper like Penny Serenade or Miss Pettigrew Lives for Day."
A lot is going on that the audience misses.
"For example, Jules has sent an email accidentally to her mother."
"She immediately goes to her tech squad--who sure enough look like

killers--to see if they can break into the server and delete the email."
"This is most likely illegal, and most likely very difficult to do."
Which her computer geeks tell her.
"Ben comes up with the bright idea to break into her mother's house, intercept the computer, delete the email."
"Also illegal, but doable."
"It's low tech, that a 70 year old would think sufficiently feasible."
"The other 3 younger interns are corralled into this adventure--and one of them immediately thinks of George Clooney's (horrendous) film Ocean's 11; Ben doesn't even think to remind them that Clooney's Ocean's 11 is itself a riff on the 1960's excellent film Ocean's 11 with the RatPack--Sinatra, Martin, Davis, etc., Now that allusion is funny."
The whole scene was high and low comedy revolving around the computer wizardry.
"It's tempting to see this movie as a conflict between the older generation born when people actually spoke to each other face to face and the newer generation that communicates via cell-phone, email, video recording, etc."
It's easy to see the movie as presenting some kind of conflict between old school and new school.
"In fact, in the move, Ben points out that the Brooklyn building she uses for her company, once housed the telephone book publishing company Ben had once been a manager in."
But the leitmotif is stated at the beginning: Plato--Aristotle's Theory of Ideal Forms.
Jules is involved in creating 'ideal' for people to attire themselves in; this occurs in the opening scene about an ill fitting bridal gown.
"And Jules attempts to fix, to fulfill this 'ideal form'."
It is a dance interweaving itself throughout the movie that propels the movie forward.
"Jules doesn't need Ben--it just so happens that Ben is very helpful, very insightful, very machismo in that way that 70 year old man are machismo with self-confidence from having lived a righteous life."
I wanted Ben to be named CEO--that would have been perfect and schmaltzy; the director--producer saw something different.
The movie works; it's a sleeper.
*** The generation gap is bridged in this 2015 film where Robert De Niro plays an active 70 year old widowed retiree who signs on to a company in their program for senior interns.
"Of course, it's never fully explained what his responsibilities shall be, but he does become the darling of the office and shows his business experience to internet clothing business lady Ann Hathaway."
He becomes involved with her life after he basically becomes her chauffeur and discovers the indiscretion of her stay-at-home husband to their young daughter.
The scene with the computer at the home of Hathaway's mother was ridiculous.
The best part of this film is the old adage of experience through age.
"Excellent I loved this movie it's perfect and touched my heart

VIEWS ON FILM review of The Intern 2015's The Intern (my latest review) is great.
"""I'll call you when I have something for you to do."""
Liked this more than I expected to.
"Its an easy watch, set up like a romantic comedy except without the romance, not sure what those movies are called?"
"A fish out of water, workplace comedy/drama following (a surprisingly likeable) Robert DeNiro as a 70 year old widower who decides to come out of retirement, mostly due to boredom and takes an internship at a trendy start up fashion company."
"Through perseverance and old school work ethics he becomes a confidant to Anne Hathaway, the overwhelmed young CEO."
"This was a really nice movie; DeNiro is very likable, nobody tries too hard to be funny and the storyline isn't sappy, it just flows... nicely

You're not short-sighted.
"There's actually nothing on the screen I hadn't fully grasped the meaning of the word ""agony"" until I went to the cinema last night and watched ""The Intern""."
"Let me start by saying that I'm by no means a cinephile, I have seen a few movies in my life and I have opinions, that's about it."
"What's amazing about ""The Intern"" is that there is not one single event unfolding on the screen that would provoke a reaction in the viewer."
"At some point I felt like checking people's pulses, as we had all been sitting there for more than an hour and I hadn't heard a single comment."
"This movie is a horrible display of stereotyped anthropology, both old and new clich√©s, with a sequence of facts narrated with no connection whatsoever between them."
"It doesn't make you cry, it doesn't make you laugh, it's just a two hour long placebo that you would watch if you were part of a control group in a lab."
But at least in that case you would get some vouchers.
"Do not buy any snacks as you'll end up with appendicitis, cause you'll devour them all in the attempt of killing time."
"When you finally think the torture is over, a ""twist"" in the story makes you dread that you will have to watch the extra time of this stalemate between boredom and uselessness."
One last warning: be ready for the cheesiest lines and shots you've ever seen.
"Close-up of toothbrushes to symbolize love, narrative stratagems that don't make any sense and a constant celebration of relationship in the most banal way are the main traits to this movie."
"The bottom line of ""The Intern"" is you should keep working like crazy and eat junk food, as long as you cycle in your own office, have a massive house in the heart of Brooklyn and make millions with the company you created."
"There is one good thing about this film though, and it was leaving the cinema to go home and watch another one."
"Sweet, fun, and funny Not sure why critics did not rate this movie higher."
It was sweet and funny.
It made me laugh and tear up a little.
I am glad I ignored the critics.
It has the feel to me of sweet funny romantic comedies of the late 30's and 40's but it isn't a romance.
The focus is on an older guy and how he relates to younger people‚Äî and visa versa.
"It reminds me of people I know, both young and old, who are open to listening and learning from each other."
Robert DeNiro was good.
Not stellar but solid.
Anne Hathaway was also solid and seemed a little bit more comfortable in her role than DeNiro.
This is the kind of movie I like.
Somewhat like real life with a mostly happy ending.
The story was not all light and happy‚Äî it had sad parts‚Äî but that is life.
Finding the good things in life and not letting the bad overwhelm you is really what it all about.
Cheers
"Lovely, good-feel Flick This is a wonderful film, with a wonderful plot."
Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway have beautiful chemistry and really make this film.
"It is paced very nicely, and has some very subtly sweet moments indeed."
"The story unfolds well, and develops into a very enjoyable watch."
The jokes and comedy wasn't overbearing.
"It is amusing and humorous in all the right places, and serious and emotional in others."
All characters are played well and are very warm and developed.
A well rounded film indeed.
Is There a Story Here Somewhere?
Have you ever watched a preview trailer and felt like you'd just watched the entire movie in 2 minutes?
"That's exactly the problem with ""The Intern""."
"If you saw the 2 minute trailer at theatres (or even the 30 second TV commercial), you've seen the entire film."
"Robert DeNiro is a retired widower (""Ben"") who gets a job working as an elder intern for Anne Hathaway's hyper-busy internet start-up company founder/CEO (""Jules"")."
They eventually bond.
Ben gets along with all the young guys and gals at the company.
Ben ingratiates himself with Jules' family.
He imparts wisdom and friendship.
The End.
"It's an interesting premise, but there's no real story here."
"There's no beginning, middle, or end to the story."
"It just starts, runs for about an hour and a half, and then just ends."
"There's an almost-interesting subplot about Jules being asked to hire a new, more seasoned CEO to be her boss by the venture capital company that funds her company."
None of the VC investors are shown on-screen.
"There's a list of 10 potential CEOs, but Jules only interviews 3 of them (all off-camera)."
Nothing really happens with this subplot.
There's another subplot with Jules' husband that was only a surprise if you've never seen any movie before.
"That subplot gets tied up easily, too."
"This is a first rate cast, and I've enjoyed some of director Nancy Meyers' previous work, but this movie is just under-cooked and kind of meanders until the final credits finally appear."
"Tight story, but shouldn't really be considered as a comedy The story is indeed a tight one as all those various complications got laid to rest with compelling conclusions."
Nothing gets left out; even the smallest story detail gets revisited and settled.
"The thing is, all those settlements are predictably good conclusions; as if this movie is riding the tide of the current trends of Hollywood movies of no matter how hard the problems presented in the movie, the ending will still be a good one."
Also I don't really think that the movie really suits a comedy genre classification since the comedies are merely there to spruce things up instead of being a major ingredient.
"There' no instance of a major laugh, no practical jokes whatsoever, and the jokes are actually only one- liners."
The end one-third of the movie's duration just really didn't have any joke on them.
The acting overall however is quite a good one.
"Robert DeNiro's acting proves that his old age can come in handy, especially to cross over to genres beyond his comfort zone of thrillers and dramas.Anne Hathaway did her usual catch for a character and played well enough."
"Quiet but pleasant This is definitely a huge change from the many movies I've seen lately, which included a hell of a lot of action and confrontation."
"This comedy, although romantic, is not the stereotypical ""poor boy meets rich girl"" story, but about an aging intern, Ben, who wants to occupy himself at a new young-staffed company, which happens to be the same building he worked in for over forty years."
"His boss, Jules, is a workaholic who forgets to sleep, eat and have fun."
"There are no bullies in the company, and everyone is cool to hang out with."
"Robert DeNiro's character, Ben, is probably the nicest, sweetest and lovable characters ever."
A dramatic contrast to the characters DeNiro usually plays on screen.
"He never gets angry once, and he only makes life better for the employees at the company."
"Despite the lack of action, deep drama and pressing moments, apart from the hilarious scene where Ben and some boys try to break into Jules' mother's home to delete an insulting message on her computer, the film was lovely, easy to watch and uplifting."
"HAllmark Family movie, too unrealistic 2 stars for snagging Robert De Niro for the movie."
And that is ALL.
"His performance was flawless as always, but this candy coated, unbelievable movie ends with no realistic resolve or point and my wife & I were felt it was a complete waste of time."
"Life just isn't like this, and there was potential for this to be so much more."
"Can a movie simply be ""too sweet""?"
"Yep, this was it."
"""You're just never home, so I cheated on you."
"But forgive me and we'll make it work""."
"Downright silly, and quite a bit of the dialogue here was sickeningly sweet."
The perfect movie for a Disney princess who wants & gets it all...I never thought I'd give a De Niro movie thumbs down.
"So sad Meaningless, pointless movie about nothing."
Giant waste of talent.
It's 2 hours of your life you never gonna get back.
Even for girls how love chick flicks this would be boring.
"IMDb requires me to write 10 lines about this movie, but frankly, the whole script to this movie can be described in less than 10 lines."
"The best description of it, is movie about nothing."
"A wife, mom and CEO with a cheating husband cries and sais thank you for taking me back when her husband tells her that he has cheated, but has decided that it was not that good, and is ready to end it."
Who writes this ?
"To Robert De Niro, please, read scripts before you decide to accept a role in the movie."

A must watch for a dozen good reasons.
You wont regret it The Intern - will go down as one of the nicest movies ever made.
A movie that speaks about A 70 year old intern played by Robert De Niro (the guy who plays the lead in The Irishman) and a young startup sensation CEO played by Anne Hathaway (the lead on Oceans 11).
The difficulties she goes through managing her busy schedules at work.
This movie will want you to appreciate your co workers more will make you value the sacrises your family does for u.
It will want to make you feel alive.
It will show that experience never goes out of fashion.A perfect weekend watch.

So sweet This film tells the story of a young woman who started an online clothing company and runs it successfully in just eighteen months.
"She takes on senior interns unwillingly, but things change for the better in almost every aspect."
"""The Intern"" has such a sweet story!"
It gives a positive message about seniors as they have much experience and wisdom on many aspects of life.
"Ben is observant, sensitive and says all the right things at the right time, therefore positively influencing everyone around him."
He's such a charismatic and likable character.
"The boss is sweet as well, I really enjoyed watching it."

Breath of Fresh Air The Intern is a really refreshing film.
"Not because it's one of the best films of the year, it's not."
"Not because it has the best performances or directing, it doesn't."
But The Intern feels different than anything I have seen this year.
"It has a senior intern for starters, but the mixture of heart and humor that The Intern carries is something special."
"It's a little long but Nancy Meyers does a great job in her wheelhouse, which is making feel good movies, and The Intern is most definitely one."
"We begin by seeing Ben, played by Robert De Niro, struggle to cope with the daily life of a retired man who is living alone in New York City."
He finds an ad for a senior internship program and the film takes off from there.
"Now, I think the film lives and dies based on how much you enjoy the two leads chemistry together."
"Anne Hathaway plays Jules, the entrepreneur/working mom, who is way in over her head with her job."
Her and De Niro have wonderful chemistry together and that's probably why I enjoyed the film so much.
There's something to be said about a relationship between a man and a woman that is zero percent sexual or romantic.
"The film does take on a certain amount of weight to the ageism angle that the trailer showcased, and those scenes for the most part worked quite well."
They worked as good comedy relief and added to the uniqueness of Jules and Ben's relationship.
I will say at times I felt fatigue with the ageism angle as it became the butt of the joke one too many times.
"Aside from one really random and out of place robbery sequence, the film flows well."
"It could have been a little tighter, but it's a heartwarming movie for all ages."
The comedy with the supporting cast works with Adam Devine and Rene Russo having key performances.
The score is charming and hits at just the right times.
But I think the best part about the film is the two leads and how great they are together on screen.
"Hathaway could have came off as a snobby businesswoman and De Niro could have mailed it in, but they both gave great performances."
The Intern is one of the more surprising films this year.

"The actors/tress did their job, but the Director is another story."
"I believe you can write a mediocre story, but if you have top rating actors you can attempt to cover the flaws."
The big problem is that the flaws of this movie are not within the main story but with the secondary ones.
"Robert and Anne story is beautifull with some scrtipt flaws, that we will speak of later but lets begin with tertiary characters first."
"Cameron, has an identity crisis."

"I had some posible asumptions during the movie, I thought, is he the villain?"
Is he trying to plot with the CEOs to take over the company?
Is he secretly in love with Jules?
"Andrew Rannells, Also you can remember him as the evil band member in How I met Your Mother series, which fits perfectly becouse he does have a Villain face."
The character and Actor do not fit.
He is misleading.
Jason and Becky.
"We were introduced with a typical ""Problems in paradise"" plot between this characters."
Are they back tocgether?
Not?
Matt.
This character is controvertial.
This movie gives the impresion that tries to uphold the views of modern feminism.
"But at the end of the movie, it all comes down to basic RomCom built up, ""The man, runs to the woman, leaving everything he did aside to keep her""."
Jule's Mother.
Another crisis without an end.
"Jule's mother doesn't say ""I love you"" back, the director doesn't seem to have interest in solving that, but does think the realtionship between them is important enough to make a whole scene in the mothers house, to which we don't hear anything else from the mother after the police went to the house."
"Fan idea: I hoped Jule's mother was the lady that follows Ben around, but Ben doesn't want anything to do with."
That would've been so funny.
Sexual Tention between Ben and Jules.
"When they go to the trip together and they are in the hotel room, Jules offers Ben to lay down in the bed and she says ""Don't worry I'll sit on the couch""."
"After she doesn't, Ben says, ""I thought you were going to sit on the couch""."
That is unnecesary.
Paige friend doesn't want to be friends with her.
"If that was just a filler comment, we could let it through, but it comes back again and again."
To the point it gave me the impresion that Paige's friend was the daughter of one of the moms that Critizices Jules.
The park scene is just an excuse so Ben can see Matt cheating.
"But instead of trying to push how Strong and Independant woman Jules is, they could've made Ben comment about parent influence their child to not be friends with paige."
Overall I believe this move tries so hard to be unique but it can't separate itself from mainstream.
Which ends up being just Awkward.
This movie does not have an Identity.
It's A Wonderful Life (In Cloud Cuckoo Land) Depending on your cynicism-count you'll either view this as a great feel-good movie or Fantasy Island writ large.
"Consider: Robert de Niro is cast as the most perfect male since Jimmy Stewart in IAWL, the most lovable guy in town dispensing wisdom like ATMLs dispense tenners while Ann Hathaway is not only drop-dead gorgeous but has single-handedly built up an online fashion company from nothing to a place on the Big Board, is adored by her employees and adorable, not to say cute, small daughter and hasn't an enemy in the world."
Conflict!
What conflict.
"I've always found deNiro grossly overrated so it was Hathaway who drew me to this one and Yes, I did knowingly surrender to its charm and wallowed in its entertainment factor for the running time but that's not the same as dismissing the flaws."
"Warm and Cuddly, Sweet and Funny I fell in love with Ben Whittaker, Robert DeNiro's character, in the first five minutes of ""The Intern."""
Ben is a seventy-year-old retired telephone book executive.
"He's super competent, humble, kind, caring, and hard-working."
His eyes twinkle and his cheeks are pinchable.
"He would make the perfect father, boss, or Santa."
Ben Whittaker is writer-director Nancy Meyers' best creation yet.
"I didn't just like Ben, I found him believable, thanks to DeNiro's superb performance."
I have to guess it's not easy playing such a nice person in a believable way.
"Ben is unsatisfied by retirement so he takes a position as an intern at About-the-Fit, a fashion start-up, the brainchild of Jules (Anne Hathaway)."
"Jules is impersonal and demanding, again, in a very believable way."
"Ben, worldly-wise and humble man that he is, makes positive changes in the company."
He is a kindly mentor to younger male employees who rarely shave and don't tuck in their shirts.
Ben explains to them why a man should always carry a clean handkerchief.
Anne Hathaway is so beautiful it's hard for me to assess her acting.
I keep focusing on her face.
I found her very believable as a driven businesswoman lacking in people skills.
The movie softens her.
There are scenes where she is revealed to have a toasty warm marshmallow heart.
I was disappointed by those scenes and didn't find them believable or interesting.
I wish the script had been as interesting and believable in its development of Jules as it was with Ben.
There are two relationships in the movie that didn't work for me at all.
Jules is married to Matt (Anders Holm).
"I could see a really beautiful, driven woman married to a charisma-free, vaguely creepy schlub like Matt, so, yes, Holm was believable."
"I just didn't want Jules, this brilliant, talented, interesting woman, to be married to Matt."
"Ben dates Renee Russo, and that relationship didn't work for me, either, although, again, it was believable."
"Ben has the wrinkled face and thinning, gray hair of a man in his seventies."
"Russo looks like a Hollywood actress fighting time, rather than like most real women her age."
Also I saw no on screen chemistry between these two.
"Linda Lavin does look like a real, older woman, and she is in the movie as a predatory, mean and obscene old lady."
There are cheap jokes at her expense.
"It's sad but not surprising that Nancy Meyers, a woman herself, depicted an older woman as an old witch, and set her up for coarse humor, and rewarded a much younger, and more Botoxed woman with romance."
"""The Intern"" is one of those rare, recent movies for adults where nothing horrible happens."
Nobody dies or behaves in a deeply despicable way or loses his cool and screams obscenities or knocks the movie off the rails.
There are no body fluids on display.
"""The Intern"" really is a feel good movie."
"If you are ever having a lousy day and you want to watch something that will give you a smile and make you feel good about humanity, please consider ""The Intern."""
Disappointing movie A movie with so much potential leaves you wishing there was an extra hour to the move so that it can end far far far better than it did.
"Instead it takes a powerful female adds a story line ""sort of"" and puts the entire female race back a good 50 years back

Two strong actors with the potential to pull the end to a far more satisfactory ending."
My family and I turned to each other at the end and were shocked to see the credits roll.
Anne Hathaway is a brilliant actress who coupled with a strong role kind of makes the movie fun.
VERY disappointing.
"Sweet and heart touching movie 'The Intern' tells a story of a retiree (played by Robert De Niro) who, after being satiated with the usual life of a retired elderly person, gets an internship at the fast-growing fashion company, and the CEO of that company (Anne Hathaway), who is an extremely determined workaholic and is torn between devoting enough time to family and work."
The intern's wisdom and support is very helpful and brings peace of mind to the constantly troubled boss.
"In the wrapper of a light comedy and adventure film, it presents some ideas which would be great to every of us to take into account: not to label people and to know that there are always more factors to play than just standard stereotypes; it is never too late to start over and pursue your happiness; sometimes during your busy life you just need to stop and look around to become happier."
"The film addresses two acute problems at once: the talent pool of retirees, whom no one wants to hire, despite their experience (or who are not taken seriously in the modern business), and the problem of balance between work and family for women entrepreneurs, who usually feel guilty for not being able to cope with everything."
"It realistically shows the problems and prejudices that these social stratas can face, without showing them ridiculous and inept."
"The plot of the 'The Intern' is exciting and funny, it contains both wonderful jokes and heartbreaking moments associated with the experiences of the main characters; the acting and the director's work are also great."
It is sweet and heart touching movie that will help recover your emotional well-being.
"*8.5 A beautiful, feel-good film."
I had a smile on my face throughout.
"Deniro, as usual, is really likable and Hathway was a treat to watch."
Having a bad day?
Watch it now!
"After all, we all are sensitive, big ball of mush."
"Fun movie, even for hipsters I'm Anne Hathaway's worst audience, but now I've been bowled over too."
What a fine performance!
It's not so easy impressing someone while making them both laugh and eat their words.
She is that rare female startup person you admire for her energy and smarts.
"Anne is genuinely lovable here and if I were casting her comic foil, the title's intern, I'd feel a bit anxious."
Who could convincingly play opposite her?
Whoever it is he's got to be someone this feminine dynamo can seem in need of.
"And here comes the star of Taxi Driver, Ronin and Heat to the rescue."
Not exactly the first person to come to mind for the part of the warm and funny gentleman who teaches these young people a thing or two about the value of old school.
"Truly, as good as Anne is, Robert De Niro is even better."
"I kept imagining the words of the script and was enthralled at how his performance made a living, unforgettable person out of them, one who never fails to get us to laugh."
"I would have to concede this film is most clearly directed at my age group, the baby boomers, but I saw it with young people in the audience and though they didn't laugh as much as we did, they weren't at all sorry they'd come to see the film."
It's heartwarming and smart and De Niro deserves an Oscar for his contribution.
Excellent Concept A good clean film.
It worths of time.
Beautiful picturized.
age is just a number Review: I really enjoyed this movie because on the surface it is a story about keeping busy after retiring but at the heart it is a story of friendship.
The direction and screenplay are both really good.
Both the casting and acting are really good also.
All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.

"Unrealistic escapist rom-com that will work only for those who love that stuff Robert De Niro has struggled to find good films or likable roles as 70-year-old actor, and accomplished rom-com filmmaker Nancy Meyers' helps the veteran get one of those right in ""The Intern."""
"Unfortunately, it's not the film."
"De Niro's Ben Whittaker, a widower who finds that typical retirement life doesn't suit him so well, is as charming a character as the movies has ever given us."
"He does all the right things, he says all the right things, he wears a suit every day and smiles all the time."
He's selected by the women's online clothing retailer About the Fit for their senior (as in senior citizen) internship program without so much as a hesitation.
"All that's well and good, if you like rosy films with perfect characters that don't reflect any ounce of reality back at you."
"That's what Meyers has done with ""The Intern."""
"The conflict in this film is all reserved for Anne Hathaway's Jules, the founder of the company who gets stuck with Ben as her personal intern/assistant and treats him coldly until she, like the rest of us, realizes how amazing he is."
"Soon he's navigating her through all the first world problems that come with being a wife, mother and CEO of a successful company."
"For those who inexplicably hate Hathaway, this film does her zero favors."
"As pathetic as ""The Intern"" comes across in the context of things that actually matter in the world, Meyers (""The Holiday,"" ""What Women Want,"" ""Something's Gotta Give"") proves masterful yet again at giving middle-aged rom-com escapist moviegoers a story they can lap up like hot chicken soup for two hours."
"But while these audiences are happy to have their films devoid of conflict and intrigue, there's a more than reasonable argument to be made that all films need some kind of conflict and intrigue."
"What little ""The Intern"" has (for two whole hours!)"
doesn't meet the minimum threshold.
How a movie can have a main character whose biggest conflict in the film involves whether to reveal important information to the supporting character and get anyone to like it is a total wonder.
Bravo to Meyers if her intent was to trick her producers into giving her money to make a feminist movie about a successful woman balancing work and life by making it appear as if she were making a film about an older male navigating a young person's working world.
"If that's the case, she's a genius, but if so, she doesn't do a good job of letting the audience in on the secret."
"Regardless of any suspicion of feminist undercurrents, however, Meyers still managed to sell a movie with poor excuses for problems and the most banal of central conflicts, and she did it by making Robert De Niro look adorable."
"~Steven C

Thanks for reading!"

Terrible Deniro used to be good but acting has passed him by as he fumbles through this disaster of a movie.
Stupid premise and idea for a movie.
Hathaway phoned it in as well.
one of the best movies i have seen in my life It is one of the movies that we felt good when we watched it when we were little.
"I don't know why, but movies starring Anne HATHAWAY make me feel that."
I recommend it to anyone who hasn't watched it.
"Excellent Movie for the Current Business Era I see how tough the world if business and managing a whole big company can be, but this movies kind of teaches that we should take it easy while still loving what we created with our own hard work and knowledge."
Failing at being entertaining and a feel-good movie.
"It's trying too hard to make a point, but it's not that relevant when you live outside of Far Left Land."
Where everything is offensive and people are labeled all the time... Not even the cast makes you want to keep watching.
And some of them are like nails on a blackboard.
"Also, they seem to be stealing too many ideas from other movies, with the same kind of premise."
It's a big fat hit and miss.

What's Not to Like?!
"This is just a sweet, fun enjoyable movie."
"I saw it and liked it when it first came out, but I've seen parts of it a few more times on tv during the pandemic and it's become one of my favorite movies ever!"
Partly because it's one of the few movies that doesn't need any cuts in order to be safe on tv on a Sat afternoon!
Robert De Niro's 70 yr old intern Ben and Anne Hathaway's uber busy company owner Jules are great together and the coworkers at Jules' company are very good as they all learn from and grow fonder and fonder of De Niro.
"It's not a hilarious movie, but there are plenty of laughs and smiles throughout."
"As a woman of a certain age, I appreciate the generational give and take between Ben and the youngsters at work."
"Not enough to come out of retirement, for sure, but enough to be able to really relate."
"This is a feel good movie for when you just need a nice, chill story."
I love it!
Plays More Like A Drama This movie begins and ends with shots of the main character doing Tai Chi in the park.
"If that sounds like an unusual choice to you, you're not alone."
Take a look at some of the complaints that people have about this movie in the reviews and you'll see that it didn't do what they expected it to.
"When they see a comedy starring the funny old guy from Fockers and the young hip lady from Devil Wears Prada, they assume that this is a fish out of water story."
"The marketing leads them to believe it will be a clash between a young professional and a retiree that rises in action, then finds a tidy resolution just in time for the 90 minute mark."
"But like the people doing the meditation in the park, this movie is more about the continuation of life than a three act arc."
"The main character, Ben, becomes an intern at an e-commerce office where the owner, Jules, is overwhelmed."
We are set up to expect several things will happen that never really do.
"At times, it is hinted that Ben will make hilarious errors related to not understanding today's technology, but he adjusts fine."
"We think he and Jules will rub each other the wrong way and hold the key to each others' happiness just out of reach, but Ben remains a capable support for Jules as she slowly figures out several of the issues she's dealing with."
"Throughout the movie, Ben's experience serves him well, a problem is solved, and life moves forward."
"It's a very Asian outlook, respecting elders and focusing less on conflict than continuation."
"Western audiences aren't trained to expect this, and that is not the only time their presumptions are turned on their side."
"There were moments that seemed to lead up to romantic involvement between them, only because other movies have trained us to look for that."
"It would have been wildly out of character in this story, but from the look of the poster, some viewers might have thought they paid for a romantic comedy."
"Fifteen minutes in, it was extremely noticeable that there hadn't been any gags, and that even though this was packaged like a comedy, it wasn't written to be one."
"This director allow the movie to be scored and edited as if the comedy beats were on the way, but this story reminds me more of the film In Good Company, which had the sense to arrive as a drama that happened to have some humor."
"Some people will pick up on these subtle inconsistencies, others will just see a sweet story about a nice old man and will get all they need despite an open-ended finish."
"I think it would have been more likable if it had a consistent tone, but it seems like the director couldn't clarify what she was trying to do and stick to it throughout."
"A terrific movie The intern story tells with widower Ben Whitaker a retired print maker who realizes that retirement is not all that cracked up that it is meant to be, he ends up getting involved in an internship for retired senior citizens and works for CEO Jules who runs a fashion company, Ben happens to be well liked by the fellow staff and even teaches them some life lessons of their own."
"While the film itself is not breaking any new territory that is groundbreaking, but what makes the film so awesome is the amazing chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Robert deniro who are quite likable on screen together."
What I found touching about the film is that you can do anything you set out to achieve as long as you believe in yourself and push to ones potential.
"A good movie option for a date night if you can absorb the unusual chemistry between its leads who are in top form Earnest performances from its talented cast manages to keep this mushy clich√©d story afloat, but with its 120+ mins runtime - it definitely overstays its welcome."
"Old man's fantasy This movie was so, so terrible."
2 hours long and absolutely nothing happened.
"The characters were all smiling plastic mannequins pulled out of a Macy's display, even Anne Hathaway who at least had half- baked attempts at depth."
"None of them were in the slightest bit believable, least of all DeNiro who was written as the perfect gentleman transplanted right out of the 1940s."
"I kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting for something to happen, for even ONE joke to be made."
"I was promised this would be a comedy, after all."
Didn't even giggle once.
"The only sequence that even attempted comedy was painfully clich√© and seemed forced, as if someone threatened the writer unless he at least tried to make this movie funny."
What you end up with is two hours of an old man dreaming about opening doors for some nice young lady who will admire him and tell her young male peers to be more like him and bring us all back into the glory days of men and why can't we all just be nice to each other without ever having anything get complicated anyway?
**SPOILER** Our strong female businesswoman lead goes on a bizarre drunken Men's Rights tirade while DeNiro stands pleasantly beside her waiting to mop up her vomit.
"It was very, very uncomfortable to watch."
Watch this with your aging parents if you want to have a bearable time with them.
"Otherwise, go watch The Devil Wears Prada which is a similar movie with Anne Hathaway and a much, much better one all around."
"Bonus - for a movie about a fashion company, the costumes in this movie were a snooze on their own."
"I don't care how relate-able they're supposed to be, people who work in fashion do not dress that boring."
"Ageist, tired movie The Intern (I) (2015) was written and directed by Nancy Meyers."
"It stars two Academy Award winners--Anne Hathaway as Jules, the president of a large and successful fashion company, and Robert De Niro as Ben, who, at age 70, decides to intern at Jules' firm."
"Writer/director Meyers has decided that there can't be any sexual chemistry between Jules and Ben, because Ben's too old."
"Ageist, but that means the plot has to go somewhere else."
Somewhere else is Jules whining and dithering over whether to hire a CEO in order to save her marriage.
(Don't ask.)
"Apparently, the producers believed that if you put two big stars in a movie, the rest will take care of itself."
Wrong.
The Intern has a so-so IMDB rating of 7.1.
"I thought it was really weak, and rated it 5."
The Worst Comedic Effort to Date Good God!
What sentimental tripe!
This is billed as a comedy.
I didn't even chuckle once.
"Usually the comedic formula is a few steady laugh out loud scenes followed by a slow degeneration into sentimental resolution, which is sickening enough to make the average Hollywood comedy disappointing at best."
This is a new low.
"De Niro's performance was awful, as well as the rest of the cast."
"Having said that, I retain a soft spot for Rene Russo, who is always top notch!"
"This effort was pure mush, dripping melted cheese by the bucket load."
One of Dante's nine circles should be reserved for the team that commission and produce this sh*t!
"My opinion A movie with a strong meaning .. a wonderful personality (ben) I wish there is in my life like him

"Overall, it's handled by the actors: Rental

Amazing.
I have just watched this.
I'm very surprised I didn't see it when it was released in 2015.
This movie is definitely going to be one of my favourites.
You can see and feel the emotions in this movie.
The acting is amazing and how everything came together to make this movie is perfect.
I would highly recommend this to everyone!!
Nancy Meyers best work; one of the better ones of 2015.
There always has been a certain aura surrounding Robert De Niro.
Very few actors to my taste possess the rare ability to be placed in front of the camera and demand almost immediate respect.
"Eastwood, De Niro, Pacino, Freeman and Walken are to name few."
"A measly plot, even weaker sub plot twists spells certain death for this Nancy Meyer screenplay."
Astute acting and a factitious approach in direction do the trick.
Nancy Meyers discovers balance and in that balance she achieves the flow in drama and humor that would get the wheels on THE INTERN rolling.
To those that are familiar with some of her work this by far will easily stand out as her best work to date.
It isn't a tangled ball of thread when it comes to sentiments although there is evidence of attempts to reach so.
Instead it's a work on chemistry of two talented Hollywood A-listers that make this movie entertaining.
Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) is a 70-year-old pensioner.
Having lost his wife 3 years ago Ben has now travelled the world but yet seems to have a void in himself that he is seeking out to fill.
A senior citizen intern program for an online clothing line catches his eye whilst running his daily errands and he takes up the challenge and enrolls in the selection process.
Jules Ortin (Anne Hathaway) the brainchild and the owner of the line is assigned Ben as her intern.
Jules instantaneously is overwhelmed with a feeling of violation as the veteran comes across as too calm and too observant ‚Äì something Jules is unable to neither fathom nor react to.
Jules on her own is an individual who most certainly has too much on her plate.
"She is constantly late for meetings, she is always rushed and often requires to remembered of what is expected of her."
The 120 minute long comedy solely rides on the shoulders of Ben and Jules.
Whose on screen chemistry is singular to the audience and is warmer with every passing minute.
The weight of the minutes fall daftly on the audience as these two put on an amiable performance with Adam Devin pitching in for humor that ensembles flawlessly.
You will not split your side with laughter but certainly will hold belly with laughter.
A good fit for date-night or just for some subtly family humor to get through the weekend.
It's a Nancy Meyer movie ‚Äì so don't worry she doesn't dig deep.
"Pablum For The Masses Boring overly sentimental drivel, how this film has a higher IMDB rating than the vastly superior ""The Devil Wears Prada"" (also starring Anne Hathaway) is mind boggling, but it does speak volume for the generic, overly PC world, we now live in, and the inability of today's audiences to sort dreck from average, average from good, and good from great."
"To see one of the greatest actors of all time, Robert Deniro, slip even further into ""Pay Cheque Bobby"", is depressing to say the least."
"A must watch for young people in corporates Following are the lessons i learned from the movie:

1: Experience always matter."
We as young people think that we know everything but that is completely wrong.OLD people have experience and which is much more than knowledge and degrees.
"2: Does Money Brings happiness: NO but helps

3: WE think richer people and big celebrities are very happy but little did we know they have a lot more stress than us in personal and professional lives

4: Family is very important."
Work is not everything.
5: We always need someone whom we can speak our heart out and whose suggestion matters to us and we do follow them.
6: We should Respect our parents and listen to them otherwise we need to search other persons whom we can treat as parents.
"Slow moving and bland, bland, bland At 70 years of age, and a widower Ben (DeNiro) discovers that retirement isn't working for him."
He hires on as an Intern at a dot com fashion house run by Jules (Anne Hathaway).
Later he sees something he should not have seen and should he tell Jules?
Like many non raunchy comedies (the Airplane movies come to mind) all the good lines and jokes are in the beginning.
After that it peters out and we are left with a soap opera.
A very bland soap opera.
"This had a world of possibilities and went way south, in my opinion."
Jules is a work-a-holic and she ends up using Ben as a calming influence..
Her company is on the verge of going broke and she needs to decide if she wants to bring in a retired CEO to help set the company on a better course.
I expected Ben to use his business experience to help Jules find her way.
"Oh, he does about 1.1/2 hours in and it's kind of glossed over."
There needed to be more of this kind of advice.
Didn't happen and we are left with a very slow-moving soap opera.
"The best and only good line: Ben is being interviewed for the job and is asked, ""Where do you see yourself in 10-years?"""
"Ben replies, "" You mean when I'm 80?"""
That's it folks.
The chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway was difficult to gauge.
"Was it them, the script or the director?"
The chemistry was okay in a bland soap opera kind of way.
See?
The company has a in-house masseuse in Rene Russo as Fiona and these scenes were uncomfortable to watch to say the least.
Do these dot com companies actually have a an in-house masseuse?
"Notable: Linda Lavin as Patty who has eyes for Ben

All in all the interview question above is the best part of this and there is no reason to continue."
"(4/10)

Violence: No."
Sex: No.
Nudity: No.
Language: One F-bomb only.
"Flawed, of course, but very likable We've all been there: going to see a comedy and praying fervently that it won't be a complete waste of time."
"Please movie, don't take a hard right at Lame Jokes Avenue.'"
You hope that a feel-good movie would finally just do as advertised.
"Fortunately for us, Nancy Meyer's first film in six years does just that."
Ben Whitaker (Robert De Niro) is a 70-year-old widower who bluntly states that retirement has gotten way too boring.
"Even vacations aren't a solution, because the final destination, home, always reminds him of his wife."
"He realizes he has to stay active, do something...anything."
He applies for a job at a fashion company that's looking for senior citizens (as a way to reach out to the community).
The company's led by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) who's so busy that she's persuaded to scour for a new CEO.
"The investors are concerned that the company could potentially crumble under the weight of its own rapid success, so someone with 'experience' is recommended."
Jules agrees to interview several candidates.
"Meanwhile, Ben, being an intern to Jules, doesn't have a lot to do, but soon finds himself becoming a mentor and a friend of sorts to Jules and aids her in overcoming not just the crises at work, but those at home as well."
I can't emphasize enough how crucial De Niro and Hathaway's acting is to the success of The Intern.
"Sure, De Niro's not venturing out of his comfort zone at all here, but he's believable and likable."
Same goes for Hathaway.
The supporting cast are a surprisingly likable bunch as well.
"Usually, comedies tend to suffer from characters who desperately try to be funny, but none of that awkwardness is to be found here."
"And that's what I found pleasantly surprising on the whole: just the complete lack of awkwardness, both in terms of acting and writing."
"The film's flaws can all be traced back to the fact that, at the end of the day, it's very much a lightweight affair."
"You could argue for hours about how De Niro's father-knows-best role undermines the film's feminist side, that the role of the massage therapist is underwritten, yada yada."
"You could make a case that the film doesn't treat its topics with the dramatic weight they deserve and you'd be right--I personally felt that the 'cheating' could've been handled differently--but then again, the film never tries to be something it's not."
The scenes featuring dramatic content are played out in such a way so as not to derail the film's overall happy-go-lucky mood and flow.
"The critic in me thinks I should be harsher, but I can't deny that I had a swell time."
A enjoyable and unexpected 'coming-of-age-again' film Is getting older a bad thing?
Walking into the cinema...
"It's not a rom-com and it doesn't have Melissa McCarthy in the lead role, could The Intern be a positive change for modern cinematic comedy?"
"Overall Rating: 3.25 stars Cinematic rating: 3.25 stars Bigger questions rating: 3 stars

Retirement has not been completely satisfying for Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro)."
"As a retired widower, he misses his wife and desires to be reconnected to his previous life in the working world."
Those connections with people and that feeling of accomplishment and purpose that drove him to get out of bed each day.
"At 70 years of age, he is given a new lease on life with a 'Seniors intern programme' at an on-line fashion site, founded and run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway)."
"Ben comes to realise that some things have changed in the workplace, but many things are the same."
"Coming into this new job, his mentor is Jules, who is not too thrilled to have him working for her."
"While he is trying to find his place in this fast pace, high-tech world, Ben finds his place in the company."
Realising he is there to help this young entrepreneur to find her place in the unforgiving world of business.
Director Nancy Meyers (It's Complicated) is known for her romantic comedies that involve those who are moving past mid-life.
This business-centred story brings together multiple generations without diminishing the value of any age group.
"There is no need for the development of romance between the lead characters, but their eventual on screen chemistry process to be effective for the progression of this trainee tale."
Meyer does keep a well-timed pace for the film and there are only a few moments where the story lags.
"Also, she delivers a comedic experience with integrity."
The Intern is not reliant on excessive foul language or flatulent jokes to make the crowd laugh.
Meyer manages to spin the central relationship as mentor/intern into something refreshing for a modern comedy.
"She capitalises on two Academy Award winning actors in the lead roles, but this becomes Robert DeNiro's film."
He delivers the business savvy and vulnerability that make this role convincing and entertaining.
"Not that Anne Hathaway and the surrounding cast do not provide the needed layers for this story to deliver, but it required someone in the lead with the experience to pull it through to the end and like his film's character DeNiro gets the job done."
"Meyer's internship narrative shows that individuals with a few more years under their belt may lack in the same energy levels as their younger counterparts, but make up for it with experience and wisdom."
"Thankfully there was a balance to the drama with the development of the relationships and characters that may leave the audience wanting more, but fully satisfied with what they received at the conclusion."
"It is not ground breaking cinema, but it is an enjoyable journey into the value that each generation can provide for one another."
Internships are meant to provide new experiences and insights for people.
"The Intern met this brief and in the process provided a few laughs, so that we do not take this life too seriously."
"In the book of Proverbs it can be read, 'The glory of young men (and women) is their strength, grey hair the splendour of the old.'"
The Intern epitomises this verse in the Bible by showing the value of various generations.
"Showing that throughout this life, there is a tendency to look upon certain ages as having greater value than others."
While this film and the verse communicate that each chapter in this life is new and the challenge is for each of us to take advantage of each opportunity that comes along.
"Some chapters may prove to be better than others, but ultimately each chapter adds to the overall richness of this life and challenge us to live each chapter as it is opened."
Leaving the cinema...
I enjoyed this film more after I had time to think about it.
"It was entertaining and I enjoyed seeing it with my young adult daughters, who said 'it was a great date movie that makes you think more about life.'"
"Good review, ladies!"

"worst ever I watched it twice to make sure I had not actually stumbled into the twilight zone of bad movies, and guess what ?"
it is worse the second time.
"the story, characters, scripts all had me feeling like I swallowed a bottle of ipecac."
the silly and corny background music really drives the point home that this thing is bad.
"watching the star of the deer hunter doing a lame imitation of mr.rogers is painful, and looking at bobby standing in that silly stance with the hands folded and making that mr rogers smile is just more than I can bear."
maybe bobby's age is to blame ?
the movie is not even worth the 10 lines that requires for a posted comment.

Beautiful What a beautiful movie!
Simple and entertaining.
Acting by Robert showed he still has the class that he is known for.
"Going on As with De Niro himself, the character he is portraying, can and will not retire."
Which is a good thing for us as viewers.
"While he won't do any action movie from now on (probably, never say never), which would be a wise decision, he can and does do comedies and/or dramas (the latter especially good with Jennifer Lawrence as leading lady)."
"This does work, even if it does sound like a one joke punch."
And it is kind of predictable for that matter.
"What I didn't expect, that it would have such a high rating in the first place on IMDb."
"It's more than decent and it seems to talk to a lot of people, whether they identify with De Niro or Anne Hathaway."
"It has something for everyone, unless you see this as a propaganda film for capitalism of course ;o) Which I'd argue is not the case, but of course that's always in the eye of the beholder to decide."
"It's light and it's fun, but does have some messages woven in between."

"Heartwarming but poor ending This film was an easy to watch, heartwarming story... until the last 15 minutes which were poor, weakened Jules character and made little sense"
"Entertaining and meaningful, De Niro and Hathaway are great together."
"We watched this at home on DVD, a Netflix rental, so no extras, just the movie."
We found it enjoyable all the way through and it has a good message about the younger generation not being so quick to discard the experience of the older generation.
"Robert De Niro is Ben, in his early 70s, retired and recently a widower."
"He has a routine, he likes to be out and about, but he still feels somewhat useless."
"He had a long career and a high position, but manufacturing phone books became a historical footnote."
"So he sees a flyer and it is for ""seniors"" to do an internship, unpaid I assume."
"So he makes his video resume', uploads it, emails it, and gets an interview."
He is selected and he will work for the young lady who is the startup manager and boss of an internet-based clothes business.
That young lady is Anne Hathaway as Jules.
"She is smart and driven, and determined to keep the business growing."
But she has a reputation of being very difficult to work with.
Ben is ultra-chill and accepts her quirks and eventually works with it.
"Jules and Ben become a team, he even becomes her driver, he gets to know her family, and eventually he becomes the substitute dad Jules needs."
"It can sound a bit syrupy when described in a few words but the characters and script are well-written, the two leads are great in their roles."
"Also good is Rene Russo as Fiona, a masseuse that works during the day at the company."
"She and Ben hit it off right away and they have their own ""start up""."
"As an interesting aside, it turns out that Jules' company is occupying the same building, the same space that Ben worked in for about 40 years."
"A surprisingly good film The Intern didn't seem to stay in cinemas that long, so I had my doubts when I picked up a copy of it cheap on DVD."
"I'm pleased to say that I found it to be a well written and well cast film, that shone a light on a different type of relationship."
I think Hollywood needs to take a lesson from this film and realise that not all stories have to be about people in their 20's.
"Both De Niro and Hathaway give good performances, and their chemistry feels natural throughout the films a little too long length."
There are a couple of scenes that could have been cut (the email to the mother and following bar scene in particular) but on the whole I enjoyed 'The Intern' and would recommend it to anyone looking for a different type of film.
"The Devil Wears Prada II So, its 7 years since she abandoned Meryl Streep in Paris."
She has setup her own internet business selling cloths.
(My imagination filling in the details).
Honestly I didn't get this movie at all.
"Robert De Niro was good, some good laughs."
But the whole story line was terrible.
Do women honestly think this happens in real life???
At the end of the movie you are there wishing you have a bucket..
PLEASE get real.
It was clich√© after clich√©..
"The actors were good, but the script was bad and just got worse as the movie progressed."
I think any successful women in business would find this movie a work of fantasy fiction.
The first half of the movie is OK.. and then it gets worse and worse.

An upbeat pleasant movie Nancy Meyers has a knack for making 'pleasant and delightful' movies.
The Intern is no different.
The flick is upbeat.
"Almost like a fairyland, where good things keep happening, and everything is quite refined and elegant."
Anne Hathway is brilliant as Jules.
"With the backdrop plot of a girl doing really well with her startup, I imagined people of her character's age group instantly relate with her."
What makes the story even more endearing is the inclusion of Robert De Niro as an intern who walks into the life of Jules as a fairy godfather.
"He comes as a pleasant surprise and makes things better for her, and takes the load off from her shoulders."
Something tells me people are really looking for someone like De Niro in their lives.
"A friend or a watchful protector who just wants the best for you, and wishes good things to happen to you, who takes the driver's seat of your life and lets you enjoy the ride, and takes the pressure off, and also helps you out with the clutter in life."
Sadly the world doesn't really work like that.
"If it weren't so dark, each one of us would be living our fantasies without life's wretched inhibitions."
The Intern is all a mere figment of Nancy Meyers imagination.
She punches in forced comedy in order to make the matter in hand sound fun.
"Eventually she tries to create tension, which is again Meyers' way of putting hurdles into her story."
Screenplay of the movie is more like conversations with a shrink.
"At one point, it seems you are witnessing one."
"We must bear in mind, not everything in this life is plushy and fluffy."
You don't always end up with unicorns and rainbows.
"Given the jovial theme of the movie, it would at once strike you how the director thinks."
"Nancy isn't a great director, but for some, she is."
"I would recommend it for people who don't really like dark, who are light-hearted and are always down for a pleasant popcorn movie."
"The most unlikely scenario that is possible in a movie (2015) The Intern COMEDY DRAMA

Co-produced, written and directed by Nancy Meyers starring movie veteran icon, Robert DeNiro as 70 year old, Ben Whittaker coming out of retirement and eventually being accepted as an intern for internet selling sensation CEO magnet, Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway)

It is the most unlikely scenario that a young internet sensation entrepreneur would employ the most inexperienced person about computers in general."
"Unless of course, if you are Robert DeNiro which a much credible scenario if both Hathaway and DeNiro were somehow related and were already made aware of one another, then yes that would be possible."

Worth Seeing for DeNiro Robert DeNiro has the uncanny ability of developing a entirely unique character in any new role.
"Based on the script of ""Intern,"" it would have been easy for him to recycle a number of characters from earlier films, turning on cruise-control for his performance."
But he never dials in a single moment in this full-bodied interpretation of his character of the intern.
"Ben Whittaker is a retired widower, having completed a successful career in business."
But he wants to be back interacting with people and to be needed.
"Consequently, he successfully applies for the position of ""intern"" in a hip, internet sales organization run by a dynamic woman entrepreneur, as played by Anne Hathaway."
"After his hire, Ben becomes the personal assistant to his boss, and film takes off with a fascinating and insightful relationship."
The astute and experienced businessman has a great deal to offer the younger executive.
"Unfortunately, the film takes a U-turn into the area of the personal when Ben observes the dysfunctional marriage of his boss and begins to offer her advice about her philandering husband."
"But the most interesting scenes were the business, as opposed to the romantic, affairs."
The final stretch of the film was disappointing in the overblown sentimentality.
Writer-director Nancy Meyers was very close to developing an insightful film about the wisdom that comes from a senior citizen and the potentially useful role that retired people may play in advising the younger generation.
"Far from being a Willy Loman, DeNiro's Ben Whittaker is a robust and astute entrepreneur with an infectious enthusiasm."
"Consequently, he he is loved by his co-workers."
One of the best lines in Meyers' script was when Ben acknowledged that he was always able to get along with everyone.
DeNiro builds on that line to masterfully create an unforgettable character.
Ben Whittaker may be a dying breed.
But he is also indispensable for the knowledge he has gleaner over seventy years.
That is an important lesson we may all learn from this film.
Breathe and relax for inner balance...... 70-year-old widow Ben is bored with retired life.
"The founder of the company Jules, is a tireless, driven, demanding, dynamic workaholic."
"But Ben proves to be quite useful and, more than that, a source of support and wisdom......"
The Intern is probably the safest film to be released this century.
"You could literally watch it with any member of your family, or work colleague, and there would be no embarrassment for anybody, because the film is just so pleasant."
"The narrative should have had Jules depicted as a very cold, unapproachable person who gradually warms to Ben halfway through the second act, this is how these films usually work."
"But no, she is very pleasant from the upstart, and the one moment where she doesn't want to work with him just fades away with all the pleasantness."
"De Niro is on form here, not his heyday form, but if you consider some of the material he's done just of late, it's pretty decent."
"His character reminds one of the Character Murphy played in Holy Man, he's always pleasant, never has a bad word to say about anyone, and is always at hand to help."
"In fact, everyone is okay and fine at the beginning, and it's coasts along like this throughout its entirety."
"Hathaway gets slightly stressed a couple of times during the film, finds out a horrible secret, and gets over it pretty sharpish, and it all finishes with the two main characters literally doing tai chi."
"Throw in Rene Russo in a really worthless role as a love interest, and this is less of a film, more of a meditation or a counselling session."
"It's not a bad film by any means, just truly uneventful, and just too pleasant for its own good."
"It's the goody two shoes of modern cinema, and will definitely guarantee to brighten up the darkest of days."
"Just be sure to check your blood sugars after viewing, this film may cause diabetes mellitus."
"A warm, and good story about the challenges of success An all star cast helps bring a great script to life."
"It's a unique, different story about friendship, family, success, pain and forgiveness."
You'll laugh and you'll cry.
But it's worth it.
Cast saves this one Here's a movie that suffers from the written and directed syndrome.. Nancy Meyers gets the credit and the blame for this one.
It is too long with plenty of fat.
The entire caper scene followed by the drinking scene when she should have gone home to the husband and child belonged on the cutting room floor.
The San Francisco fire alarm sequence felt forced to meet the writer's need for the needed bedroom talk scene.
"And there was the on television scene from ""Sigin' in the Rain"" that made you wish you were watching that great film rather then this contrived one idea movie."
Hathaway and Di Niro make this watchable but they deserved tighter and better.
After two hours everything is about where it was in the first five minutes.
No need to see this in a theater as it will play well on a home platform.
Acting experience never grows old.
Thought i would catch this to kill a few hours on a cold Wednesday afternoon between shifts.
"It immediately grabbed me as a good old fashioned Sunday TV matin√©e that I used to watch many many years ago,,But 10 minutes in it changed into a fantastic masterclass in acting."
"Incredible performance from Bob DeNiro which could have been written for him in mind but for me Anne Hathaway completely runs the whole show.This is an excellent ""Coming Of Old Age ""movie which gives us just enough mush to keep a dry eye."
( Well...most of us anyway).
The chemistry between these two was electric and the on-the -bed scene was done with loving taste with no hint of anything but friendship.
As a 53 year old male I could associate with the idea of having experience with decisions that seem over important but just need to be stripped down to black and white...the answer is usually in front of your eyes if you don't think too hard.
I've given it a very unusual 7 because this is a modern day classic for young and old.
Brings to mind Al Pacino in Danny Collins..a lifetimes acting experience served up with pure raw emotion.
"Corny, hammy drivel!"
"Honestly sat down to watch this with my sister, mum and partner thinking it would be a funny watch."
Turned out to be the slowest film ever with no direction to it whatsoever!
Great cast - thou they had to act through the worst plot and dialogue.
Corny and overly sentimental throughout - had us all rolling our eyes on multiple occasions.
Not sure what this movie was trying to achieve but failed on every level.
"So weird in places too - when she says to him your my best friend, when they sit on the bed together.. so strange."
I am not sure what the other reviewers were watching!
Feel like I have lost two hours of my life I can never get back!!
Do not waste your time.

"Amazing movie to watch with your family Well, I just watched the movie and my only regret is that I should have watched it with my wife."
"Although It's probably okay, I'll watch it a second time with her later."
I know I'll enjoy just as much.
I have loved Anne Hathaway in every movie I have seen of her.
She once again did an amazing job.
"I'm not saying she deserves an Oscar for it, but I also wouldn't be surprised if she got nominated."
She perfectly succeeded to capture her role: A woman who loves her job and her family and wants to make everyone who matters to her happy at all costs.
"Oh, did I mention she was great?"
Where would the movies be today if it wasn't for Robert De Niro?
Show me a single person who doesn't love him.
"I'm serious, show me!!!"
Once again he did it.
He plays a senior intern in a huge up and coming company.
That's all I'm going to say.
I'm not going to praise him or say that he was good.
I'm going to say that he is the soul of the movie and I loved seeing him.
"But that's just me, I love him in anything."
There are some scenes in the movie that kind of vaguely reference other movies that the stars have played.
It was really fun for me to watch this scenes.
"There's of course the bride whose name is Rachel (Rachel Getting Married (2008)), the scene where Ben is talking to himself in the mirror (Taxi Driver (1976)) and of course my personal favorite, the airplane scene where Ben and Jules are chatting (Midnight Run (1988))."
"Gosh, I was so excited to think that He might do his iconic laugh."
"All in all, this is an amazing movie that you need to watch with people whom you love."
"I assure you it will a good two hours, for all of you."
"7,1 ?"
????
"This is one of the worst movies ever, only De Niro is good,, in a way."
"terrible movie i am so bored to write why,, the rating for this movie made me write this ""review"",,, so funny."
This movie had potential This movie hurt to watch.
"The writing was terrible and seemed like events were thrown in at random, fluidity never considered."
What was up with the mom-daughter relationship?
Why not elaborate a little on what was going on?
"The ""heist"" scene--you build Jules' character into this hard working woman, and suggest she'd reach out to her team to help with such a ridiculous problem..It seemed like at some point the writer decided that we needed adventure and threw this in because that's all she had."
And the marital issue was clumsy..Very slow moving.
"The worst part--and the reason I had to write this review--was that ""The Internship"" was more entertaining EVEN THOUGH this movie had better first-rate actors."
It almost seemed like Robert DeNiro was being a good sport and doing a favor in making this movie.
Glad I rented.
"Fantastic Great movie, rarely comes to watch such a nicely made movie."
"These would be watched daily, but very few films reach this level."
The score I gave is already top for me.
"A For Age And A For Chemistry I kind of backed into this picture by watching the second half first, then going back and watching the whole film."
Doing so gave me perhaps a different feel as I was kind of amused watching the latter though not quite sure what inspired it.
"When I went back and started it from the beginning, I was more impressed."
Robert De Niro appears to be making a pretty good comedy career in films now.
In this movie he is 70 year old Ben even though he is actually older than the role he is playing here.
He is the special Senior Intern at an Internet firm who comes in as a widower bored with retirement.
So he signs up for the special program.
He comes into the company and immediately impresses everybody he is in contact with.
Then he works his way into life with the CEO Jules played excellently by Anne Hathaway.
The chemistry between these two is actually developed more into the second half of the film.
Ben works on helping Jules sort out her business life and her personal life which are totally modern dynamic in different ways.
"What this script does use effectively besides subtle humor, is the way the characters backgrounds are filled in, particularly Ben and Jules, as the film moves along."
The circumstances of the film allow for character development which is rare in this kind of film.
"While the message that older workers is valuable for an aging baby boom operation, the more important message he is that technology is a thing that can be used to bridge generations rather than separate them."
"This film is very effective in the emotional aspects of a life of having it all, and the prices of that."
Rene Russo is very effective in support with scenes with De Niro here too.
"The messages here are comedy and the search for a happy life, and the fact that money and age are not really the answers to the happiness problems."
Sometimes a happy life is all in making the right connections.
This film does that.
Refreshing The trailer shows the potential for the film to be pretty comedic and though there are quite a few funny moments I wouldn't really call this a comedy.
To me it is somewhere between a melodrama/comedy/drama type thing.
I really like that this film goes against the patriarchal order of most films (and reality) by having a strong female protagonist.
"However, it does subtly hint at the question of 'can she really do it all?'"
which is a horrible question to ask as it undermines the female gender by saying women can't be successful at both work and home life.
"Plus, Jules is never seen having any other friends, implying that a successful woman can't have a personal life."
"Hathaway gives a solid performance as a hard-working, always busy and on the phone type person with focused drive."
She is believable as a person who manages to start a start up and make it successful.
De Niro plays a grandfatherly type of character and puts the young boys to shame with his gentleman persona.
"Thus, with De Niro's grandfatherly character the film leans more towards a family film rather than a comedy."
"Not that this is a bad thing, as Meyers does a good job at integrating the different generations together and showing the lessons that each can learn from the other."
"The look of the film is also very modern, and I like the cinematography and visual colours of the settings."
Camera work does well in establishing the high rise buildings and modern architecture of the city (New York?)
which parallels the fast paced generation of online companies.
"Additionally, the colours are very vibrant which add to the modern concept."
"The contrast between the mise-en-scene, and other characters place Ben as a creature in endangerment of being extinct, a dying breed of chivalry."
"Although Ben's character does add some taste to the film, the ending inevitably ends with him (the white male) giving advice or having his say that inspires the solution."
"This reminds me a little of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, when the father (another white male) gives his verdict that everyone must listen to and agree on, though it is not so extreme in this case."
"Overall, the film is an entertaining feel good movie for a relaxing Friday night."

"Not much of a plot, but it's got a heart."
"And with De Niro and Hathaway, that's enough... A retiree in his early 70's still feels the 'music' in his heart and needs a job to keep busy and cope up with the recent loss of his wife."
"Ben is the name and Robert De Niro plays the man in a heart-warming performance, reminding us how a likable actor he can be, given the right role."
"And since generation is a recurring theme in Nancy Meyers ""The Intern"", I couldn't help but think that he belonged to a generation that provided some of the best characters of cinema's history, many of them incarnated the tormented and rebellious youth of the 70's, and it sure tells you how time flies, watching Johnny Boy or Travis Bickle embodying a figure, whose respectability relies a lot on the age."
"Let's get back to the story: Jules is the founder and manager of a clothes' online selling company, she's in her early thirties and tries to combine her private life (married with a child) and her time-demanding business."
"She belongs to the category of self-made women, Oprah Winfrey disciples, who regularly make the cover of female-oriented magazines, and I liked how the film, directed by a woman, didn't overplay that aspect, as Hathaway is totally opposite to the bitchy Miranda Priestley, who was her boss, ten years before in ""The Devil Wears Prada""."
"The young intern grew up and she has a more progressive view on management as her company hires senior people to do intern job and this is how Ben makes his entrance and what do you know, he'll change, if not everyone's lives, but their personal perspectives on life."
"That's it, Jules is reluctant first but progressively, the help of Ben gets more and more precious and their professional bond develops into a genuine friendship that slowly transcend their generation gap."
"In the process, Ben helps also the other interns, providing them an example of how a man from the old school behaves."
"He's a guy who always wears suits and tie, who practices gallantry and whose presence reassures and oozes respect."
"This is a character-driven story without any twists or tricky situations of misunderstanding, and that the screenplay had the guts to avoid any artificial devices to make the story move forward (I expected at some part that Jules' assistant will turn into a villain) and keep on the same level of sweetness between the characters is a stunt I admire, it doesn't take risks, but that's a risk in itself."
"It all comes down to one simple observation: ""The Intern"" doesn't have much of a plot, but it's got a heart, and that might be enough."
"I'm not sure every movie can get away with a similar story-line without sinking into corniness sooner or later, but this is where the actors' performances help."
"And when you have Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway playing together such common roles, well, an uncommon chemistry grows and it owes a lot to their positive personalities."
"And it works for a simple reason, these two persons have a generational gap, obviously, you can't be born four decades apart and expect to have similar views on life, and obviously Ben has a lot to teach and Jules is receptive."
"She has concerns, she worries about her life and she listens to Ben, and Ben doesn't take any pride from it either."
"There's something I really liked in ""The Intern"" is that in a film that has all the reasons in the world to play the feminist card, you have a young successful woman who displays nervousness, lack of self-esteem, and emotional vulnerability, and it takes a man who belongs to the ancient generation to reassure her."
This is very revealing of the twisted aspect of feminism and the preconceived ideas we have on our elder.
"First, Jules is totally aware that she's successful but listen to her speech during a party, the way she blames boys for not being enough of men, how we came to manhood models like Harrison Ford to geeky wussies is the trigger of her anger towards men."
Many women take care of themselves because society has forged a generation of men who were too cowardly to take their responsibilities.
"I was born the same year than Hathaway and while I don't consider myself a 'millennial', I reckon that the Internet, Facebook, simplified the relationship and never taught us to learn how to confront people directly, court a woman or break up without using a phone."
"There's not just a generation gap but also a gender gap that the film subtly points out, and the idea is that guys have lost the ability to earn what they achieved."
"And this is why Ben is sincere when he tells Jules that she's got nothing to sacrifice just to please her cheating husband or her employees, he doesn't see her as a woman but as a person who achieved something worthy of admiration."
"And this self-esteem, this capability to work your way through success is well received by the other interns."
"In the context of a current cinematic trend encouraging a sort of clash between genders, saying that women are exploited, guys have the best roles etc."
"It is refreshing to have a film that doesn't go for the polemic and show these realities in a more partial and friendly way, it is full of positive vibes, and I liked it for that."
"Maybe I wish the film had tried to put a little more complexity in the plot and adds some nuance to the character of Ben who was might be too much of a boy scout and perfect for the role, you'd almost expect him to reveal that he's an angel."
"But in fact, the reason he put so much love in his work is because love and work are the two main drivers of life."
And that's what the film is about: love and work.
enjoyable start-up melo Should I feel guilty?
"I really enjoyed this melodramatic, stereotype-rich, rose-water sprinkled feel-good movie which is 'The Intern', directed by Nancy Meyers, and bringing to screen the improbable pair of actors composed of Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway."
Now I need to find out why.
"One of the reasons is probably the fact that the start-up and corporate environments are pretty familiar to me, and that their screen version as conceived by Meyers is not far from what I know."
"Yes, I have met the ambitious CEO working herself (or himself) to death at the expense of her (or his) family life, sleeping time and own health and reason."
I worked and still work in 'open space' and 'glass-walled' environments.
I lived through 'the sale of the day' and 'the hero of the month' and I understand what a good day and a bad day looks like in the shop that some believe it became their real home.
"Then, I am a feminist."
"I sincerely believe that women can be better managers than men, and that they deserve all the credit when they succeed in the machoistic society we live in, and even more when they do it while keeping a family and raising kids who still recognize their mothers."
For feminists this film carries the 'right' message.
Third (or maybe first) I am close to retirement.
"Not 70 yet, as De Niro's character is, not wearing suits and ties (actually I know a lot of 70-ers who never do), but yet, I can understand his panic when faced with aging, his loneliness and desire to socialize, his volunteering in order to continue to be useful and relevant."
"The story of the 'retired intern' who becomes the best friend of the carrier-obsessed CEO by balancing the over-dynamic corporate environment with some old-fashioned common sense, the crisis of the millionaire teenagers with true sensitivity may have been told a few times."
"Yet it looks true on screen, or better said true enough to spontaneously generate the laughs and the tears rather than squeeze them."
The actor who played all those tough gangsters in the first two thirds of his fabulous career has become the most generous and kind retired and his chemistry with flamboyant Anne Hathaway is perfect.
Rene Russo is just the best known of a fun support cast.
"The Intern' will be criticized by many for taking life too easy, but if you are a fan of feel-good movies, or you just are in the mood of seeing one you would certainly like to watch it."
A beautiful movie I was a little sceptical of this movie especially when I saw the length (2 hours is really long) and I was not quite sure what sort of plot could be developed to make it worthwhile.
I must say that it was worth it.
This was just beautiful.
"Beautiful, well developed characters."
A story line with hope and promise and self-belief.
I enjoyed how Robert De Niro's character fathered/grandfathered Anne Hathaway's Jules.
It was a beautiful relationship.
I loved that the film was 'clean' and pure and the little comedy in the midst of it all just sorta provided that well needed release that good humour tends to bring.
I thoroughly enjoyed myself.
"When a young-age success hires an experienced intern, only to learn the basic rules of the office called ""life""."
"The Intern (2015) : Brief Review -

When a young-age success hires an experienced intern, only to learn the basic rules of the office called ""life""."
"The Intern is a sweet little film with a sweet little thought and a sweet little process, but it takes a little longer than that little to make sure that you understand that little thought behind it."
I guess I have summed everything up in one long sentence.
"The film is about a seventy-year-old widower, Ben Whittaker, who learns that post-retirement life is easy but hellishly boring."
"Seizing an opportunity to get back into the game, he becomes a senior intern at an online fashion site, founded and run by Jules Ostin."
"As you expect, his presence makes things better for the office and, most importantly, for the young, dynamic, and successful Ostin, who had initially hated him."
The script is predictable but not boring.
"Maybe those two hours look long, but for the first time viewing it isn't a big problem."
"The writing makes it easy for you, but then there is a goofy screenplay that makes it difficult for repeat viewing."
"There is no such big, thoughtful message in the film, so don't hold your breath waiting for it."
"Some of the old cliches work, some fail."
"That adult humour makes you laugh once in a while, and there are typical Nancy Meyer tricks with just the right dose of comedy."
I loved that first massage scene and the Ocean's movie reference scene.
"The dialogues aren't great, but good enough."
"""You are never wrong to do the right thing,"" yes, they copied Mark Twain's quotes, with credit ofcourse."
"Robert De Niro has performed well, but I think those repetitive expressions could have been avoided."
Anne Hathaway looks damn beautiful in every single scene.
"She acts bad in some scenes, or was that a natural fumble?"
"I am not sure, but the rest of the time, she is really nice."
I am not a big fan of Nancy Meyers' films.
"I just watch them once and then forget them in a day or two, and I guess that's what's gonna happen with The Intern too."
"Nevertheless, it's a feel-good film with evident one-time watch values."
"RATING - 6.5/10*

By - #samthebestest."
Great Film --I'm so sick of seeing SWAT teams with Machine Guns Nice relaxing movie Although for a minute there I thought De niro .
Was Gonna Get Upset some when he saw Hubby Pulling a Fast one .
I was Seeing that Guy Taking a little ride in the trunk of a Lincoln Continental.
"Like in Good Fella's .No cheesy moments, no extra complexity, no flashy sets, no crappy lines...... two of the best people telling us to smile and relax while they r doing what they r best at."
"A Feel-Good Film ""The Intern"" is not a romance."
"It is a feel-good movie, and a very effective one."
"Anne Hathaway stars as Jules, a young woman who runs a successful internet sales company that she started from scratch."
That's a good start.
"Ms. Hathaway is beautiful, talented and extremely likable."
"Her character struggles with success on two fronts--in business she is very hands-on but she can't do everything herself, and in her personal life she can't find the time necessary to make her husband and daughter the priorities they should be."
"In short, she wants to ""have it all"", but she has compromised and come up short."
"Robert DeNiro is Ben, the retired widower who becomes an intern at Jules' company, hoping to fill the hole in his life."
The story has plenty to say about inter-generational relations and about feminism.
Hathaway and DeNiro--and the other characters in this film--play their parts with warmness.
"Unlike many other comedies, there is hardly a trace of snarkiness."
"The lessons learned have to do with being genuine, and searching for what you need in life."
Who said a comedy can't be life-affirming?
"""The Intern"" is and it offers the bonus of gently guiding the viewer toward real issues that everyone deals with."
"Despite being somewhat routine, and clich√©d, the movie works."
"THE INTERN': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)

Robert De Niro costars in yet another Hollywood comedy flick; this one was written and directed by Nancy Meyers."
"He plays a 70-year- old widower; who goes back to work for a Brooklyn e-commerce fashion business, as part of a senior intern program."
"Anne Hathaway also costars, as his new boss."
"The movie also features Anders Holm, Adam DeVine and Rene Russo; in supporting roles."
Ben Whittaker (De Niro) is a retired 70-year-old widower.
"He's became very lonely, and bored, in recent times."
"So he decides to apply for a senior citizen intern program, at a business in Brooklyn; called 'About the Fit'."
"He's assigned to work with the company's 'work obsessed' CEO, named Jules Ostin (Hathaway)."
"Everyone that works with Ben, immediately takes a liking to him; except Jules, who he initially annoys."
"She quickly gets passed that though, and the two form an unlikely friendship."
The movie is sweet and funny.
"Both De Niro and Hathaway are good, and extremely likable, in their roles; and the supporting cast is all adequate."
"The film is a little cheesy, and definitely nothing special; but it is amusing, and somewhat emotionally involving."
Meyers did a pretty good job with it.

Such a cute movie.
There was something fresh and warm about it.
"Gave me all the good feelings üòá
2 out of 3 found this helpful."
"Nice story... ""The Intern"" is a Comedy - Drama movie in which we watch a seventy-year-old man becoming an intern on an online fashion site."
He discovers a new world for him but he is excited about it since he wanted a new challenge in his life because retirement was boring for him.
"I liked this movie because it had a nice, simple and interesting plot that in combination with some good interpretations made by the cast made it even better."
The direction which was made by Nancy Meyers was good and she did a great job on the way she presented her main characters and their back stories.
"The interpretations of Robert De Niro who played as Ben, Rene Russo who played as Fiona and Anne Hathaway who played as Jules were also very good."
"To sum up, I have to say that ""The Intern"" is a nice movie to spend your time with and I am sure that you will have a great time watching it."
Sweet Delight This movie was sweet.
I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.
"It's nice to have movies that aren't always packed with action, drama, or profanity."
Just simple and sweet.
The movie is entertaining and watchable but nothing amazing and I thought Somethings Gotta Give was better.
"""Back in action."
"Thank God."""
Ben (De Niro) is a retired widower who is bored with his life.
When he finds a flyer looking for interns at an internet company he applies.
"When he is chosen is is very excited, but when he meets the owner, Jules (Hathaway) his excitement begins to waver."
"Ben has been around long enough though and slowly he helps Jules not only with her company, but her life as well."
"This is not a bad movie at all, but really nothing more than fluff."
"On the other hand, when you watch the preview you pretty much expect that."
"Overall, a movie that would be easy to watch over and over but De Niro has come a long way since Raging Bull and Taxi Driver."
I give it a B.
The Intern 70-year-old widower Ben Whittaker has discovered that retirement isn't all it's cracked up to be.
"The Intern is directed by Nancy Meyers, stars Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway."
"If - like me - you've seen Something's Gonna Give, It's Complicated, What Women Want or The Holiday you probably know that they've earned more than one billion dollars worldwide."
So the odds are good that you have - you'll undoubtedly have certain expectations for Nancy Meyers latest movie.
And they will almost certainly be met.
I love her movies.
This film is not the cheesy melodramatic comedy type; but a far more smart and clever mature comedy.
Robert De Niro is a genius.
"We all know he's a fantastic actor, one of the best of his generation."
"This man truly is an actor, the genuine one still alive."
He's what guys should aspire to be when they're 70.
"He's classy, he's sharp, he's charming and optimistic."
Important things here I really do love him in this movie.
"Plus, he's a good contrast with Hathaway's character."
Anne Hathaway performance has a really nice core as throughout the movie you understand why she is the way she is.
"She graduated to the role of corporate fashion dragon, she's even permitted - not sure everyone saw that - in a witty touch, to toss her jacket to Ben in the blase manner of Meryl Streep's Miranda Presley in The Devil Wears Prada."
Moreover she gets to deliver a wince-worthy sermon to three of her twenty-something male employee bemoaning the decline of Masculinity and decorum in modern men.
"Jack Nicholson and Harrison Ford (not to mention De Niro himself), by contrast, are held up as superior role model's of ""cool""."
The Intern appears like a generation gap fable or 21st century outlook on age and gender.
The central theme is really about the younger generation versus the older generation and the different ideology of both generations.
How an old person approaches something and how a younger person does.
"The major message is taking a breath, relaxing, take time to retire from the hectic world and just take a minute to appreciate your surroundings."
"Finally, a Nancy Meyers productions isn't just a film; it's a cashmere jumper unto itself."
"Overall, The Intern is a light hearted and fluffy movie."
It's not groundbreaking but a really good time!
Touching and excellent I am a member of IMDb for years and years...
This is my first review because this movie deserves it.
"I watched soon many movies, my favorites are sci-fi mostly but this movie is gorgeous!"
"It was very touching, heartwarming and you took some lessons from it literally!"
De Niro... 'The perfect man'...
He plays the gentleman perfectly like he plays the mafia in other movies...
He is a legend and he shows it with this movie too.
Anne Hattaway...
"Simple, pure and talented."
"You did a great job, i want this kind of synergy much much more."
"Thank you very much, you made our day excellent!"
A Rather Unique Relational Movie 22 October 2015.
Robert DeNiro and Ann Hathaway star in this dramatic comedy about an elderly intern to an e-business executive.
"Directed and written by Nancy Meyers, The Intern offers up an entertaining and finely balanced movie about growing older, about females balancing business and personal responsibilities at home, and about close relationships in general."
It is an engaging look at contemporary life and the human element that we often take for granted.
The Intern is hard to rate because it's much more reflective of life than the dramatic stylish script the audience and critics have often come to expect.
"Nancy has incorporated intense, sensitive dramatic scenes which derive from the natural human state of existence rather than the oftentimes overly dramatic scenes for audience reaction."
"The ending of this movie is a case in point, it doesn't end with explosive titillating satisfaction, but with a soft landing of the expected natural consequences of life trying to work itself out."
This movie resembles coming of age comedy-dramas like Uptown Girls (2003) or Waitress (2007) but for the elderly with somewhat older established women.
"There is also some suggestive elements that could even come from the Best Oscar classic Roman Holiday (1953) with its primary emphasis less on the romantic comedy than on the experience of everyday business life, such as Ann Hathaway experienced in own her breakout film The Devils Wears Prada (2006)."
"What's remarkable is that The Intern reflects one of the few movies that doesn't focus on a romance plot and instead uses another relational theme as the movie's core and still is able to captivate and move the audience, a rare and difficult accomplishment in itself."
"Even so though, unlike Lost in Translation (2003) the ending doesn't seem to quite able to smooth out the uncomfortable mental ruffles."
Better than expected The Intern is a relatively small minded comedy drama starring Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway.
"This film ended turning into a success at the box office, while it was appropriately released at a proper time and had a lengthy stay."
The Intern is good due to the cast of its lead and their chemistry throughout.
"Although predictable, it works well here and the film isn't as soapy or cheesy as one would have expected."
"Several subplots come into the film in the second half as it deserts itself from another plot, or there may be some plot twists that occur but these things keep the film entertaining and never boring."
"Overall, the Intern is a solid comedy if you are into these type of films."
A movie of life time One of the best movie must watch.
You can watch it again and again .
The Vidiot Reviews....
"The Intern

Nowadays, most retirees have to return to the office in a janitorial position."
"Thankfully, the widower in this comedy doesn't have any dependents living in his basement."
"Feeling obsolete since retiring from his job, former phone book publisher Ben (Robert De Niro) returns to the workplace as a senior intern for an online fashion house."
"Assigned to the site's workaholic founder Jules (Anne Hathaway), Ben quickly becomes an indispensable part of her life, thanks to his sage wisdom."
"But his ethics are tested when he learns a secret about Jules' husband that could send her into a tailspin, and her website under."
"In spite of its far-fetched premise, obvious plot points and sitcom- esque situations, this coming-of-old-age comedy is wryly writing and playfully acted by its charming leads, whose chemistry is awkwardly comforting."
Although you do have to constantly reassure senior staff that women are allowed to wear pants to work.

Should Not Be Listed As 'Comedy' I was led to believe 'The Intern' was a comedy film.
"This is how the film was marketed, sold and listed."
Sadly this is not the case.
It is a 'feel-good' film.
It's not a soppy love story and nothing climactic or 'explosive' happens at all.
"So yes, I was disappointed not to be rolling on the floor and wetting myself with laughter."
But I was genuinely happy for the 2 hours to watch two different lives come together and form a great relationship.
I just wish that this was not listed under the 'Comedy' category.
They should put it under a 'Feel-Good' category or a sub genre a la 'Light Hearted Drama'.
"Anywho, 6 / 10 for me."
"Nice, happy, jolly film."
Goes on a bit too long and nothing really happens but still...
Happy happy happy :)
"Charming but there's not a whole lot going on Some movies get green lit on the strength of their story and script, while others get green lit based on the star power they've managed to sign on."
This is the latter and there's no problem with that.
"Some movies with certain actors in the lead role would be absolutely dreadful, whilst with other actors in the same roles could be absolutely brilliant."
I new Robert De Niro was one of those actors and now I've had it confirmed for me that Anne Hatheway is as well.
"De Niro recently starred in 'Dirty Grandpa' with Zac Efron and took a bit of flack over that, with people questioning whether his days of tremendous acting performances are over."
While he may never have another role like he did in 'Casino' or 'Goodfellas' or 'Taxi Driver' he can still act absolutely exquisitely.
Hatheway I've never been sure over.
"She absolutely blew me away in 'The Dark Knight Rises' as Catwoman but in that case she was working with Christopher Nolan, arguably the finest film director working today."
She had also not overly impressed me in a few things so I was a little undecided on her.
In 'The Intern' she brings a charm and levelness to the character that throughly impressed me and confirms that she is a very fine actress and should be kept an eye on in the future.
The script doesn't have a lot going on but at the same time it never pretends it does.
It knows it's not thought-provoking enough to win Academy Awards.
It is content with giving a couple of great actors (along with a great cast of supporting actors) a couple of hours to charm an audience.
It does what it sets out to do well.
"Charismatic Chemistry Between De Niro and Hathaway Not to confuse with 2013 Fox's The Internship, this similar type of drama without a ship behind feels more promising, funny but not ridiculous and thoughtful which one could have expected through its poster."
the model of gentleman The main characters are Ben and Jules.
"Ben is 70 years old, but he likes to challenge new things."
"One day, he finds an advertisement of intern."
He decides to challenge it.
"Then, his new life starts."
His new work place is a company of apparel fashions.
"He is assigned to under direct to Jules, the CEO of company."
"At first, he doesn't have any knowledge, but he does hard what he can do."
"Gradually, people around him like him, also Jules gets to like and believe him because of his character."
"Also, Jules has a problem about family, so Ben becomes a good adviser."
This movie can cheer people who work or do something hard.
They can think to continue to do.
I will watch this movie again if I lose my confidence.
"Also, you want a warm adviser like Ben."
"Ben is a good example of gentleman, so I hope men follow him."
"Internal Prominently promoted with the tagline ""Experience never gets old"", this Nancy Meyers movie spins a familiar tale of an old man proving his worth (despite being technologically backwards) and impressing the younger folks around him."
"The basic story is quite predictable and all the anti-ageism messages are nothing new, however, the film has an undeniable charm to it and a surprising amount of energy."
"On occasion, the tale feels a little too sweet, such as how Robert De Niro's character becomes a mentor and father figure to all his colleagues so quickly, however, it is all the quirky comedy that stands out."
A particularly amusing subplot has De Niro engineering what him and his colleagues describe as an 'Ocean's Eleven' style heist.
Celia Weston additionally has a fun bit part as a spunky temporary chauffeur.
Meyers also handles the inevitable romantic tension between the stars quite well.
"There is one scene where it looks like things are about to turn passionate between the pair, however, the situation is eventually diffused with De Niro's stares and body movements conveying his discomfort without any need to blatantly state it."
"In short, this is a far more agreeable film than might expect given the past credentials of its director and De Niro's uneven movie choices of late."
"This is probably his most solid performance since 'Silver Linings Playbook', cool cameo in 'American Hustle' aside."
A perfect feel good movie.
"The Intern touches on several great subjects like old-age dating, stress, relationships and forgiveness."
Great acting throughout but especially DeNiros body and face movements made a positive suprise.
"Perfect ratio of drama, comedy and romance."
This movie made me feel especially happy and this is why it deserves the spot as my first written review.
A movie whose time has come ...
Although I'm a lover of the cinema I've never written an IMDb review.
But after watching the trailers for this upcoming film I wouldn't miss it for all of the peaches in Georgia.
"As long as it lives up to the promises made in the trailer, it's going to be a slam-dunk, hum- dinger that was absolutely made for this time."
"Imagine a bunch of aging baby boomers who keep asking themselves, ""What happened to the world I used to know?"""
and then watch the back-and-forth between Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway.
Mr. De Niro plays a retired businessman who quickly grows bored with his apres-career life so he dives back in as an intern for a young female CEO that is played by Ms. Hathaway.
It's pregnant with possibilities ... hilarious as well as soul-stirring possibilities.
Holy cow.
This so resonates.
"I'm fifty-eight, retired and trying to write my own memoirs but it feels as if someone's beat me to the punch."
If the film doesn't deliver as I think it will I'll return and revise what I've said but for now it's on my DON'T MISS list.
"Suits rule, experience counts and grey hair is dad-gum attractive."
Good luck to the creators of this film!
"***10/19/2015*** Okay, I'm back."
Saw the movie with the wife last weekend.
I was ready on the gong and was prepared to take back whatever I said earlier.
Soooooooooooo ..........
I was right.
It's one of the best movies either of us have ever seen.
"The humor, the cuteness, the chemistry between Ann Hathaway and Robert DeNiro made it a HUGE departure from today's cinema norm."
It was also chock-full of morality and morals that anyone from any generation would do well to emulate.
"I'm fifty-eight: college educated, former military, retired business owner, and I still tuck my shirts and polish my leather shoes."
But this isn't an old fogies' film.
"It juxtaposes the old, flip phone generation with the new iPhone generation in such a charming way that I can only say ... go see it."
It's the picture I would have made if I'd chosen a career in film production instead of the business in which I spent over almost 30 years.
I hope there's a sequel.
Great movie Great actors.
Great story.
The movie brings positive vibes.
I just feel short at the ending but everything about this movie is great.
Boring tropes Politically correct movie with bizarre story telling and things just working out.
Need 10 million dollars?
Here you go.
Because it's that kind of movie.
"Feel-Good Comedy Like They Used To Make I saw ""The Intern"", starring Robert De Niro-Grudge Match, The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle; Anne Hathaway-The Dark Knight Rises, The Devil Wears Prada; Rene Russo-Nightcrawler, The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle and Adam DeVine-Modern Family_tv, the Pitch Perfect movies."
This is a comedy about and for adults.
"It's not a romantic comedy, just a comedy."
"The main message here is that just because a person is old, they can still have purpose-there is an old saying about with age comes wisdom, and that point is proved here."
"It is written and directed by Nancy Meyers, who also directed It's Complicated, The Holiday, Something's Gotta Give and What Women Want."
Robert plays a 70 year old retiree who is a widower and is bored just sitting around the house.
He decides to go back to work and finds a job at an online fashion site.
Anne started the company about a year and a half earlier-it is a new company-and she is trying a new program of hiring senior citizens as interns.
"At first, Anne has doubts about the program but soon realizes that it was the best thing she could have done."
Robert shows her that experience does come in handy.
Rene plays a physical therapist that gives massages to employees and her and Robert get into a little massaging outside of work.
"Adam is a fellow intern that is not a senior citizen but does learn a few things from Robert, both about his job and his personal life."
The movie is a feel-good movie that reminded me of the comedies from years ago.
"It's rated ""PG-13"" for some language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 1 minute."
I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD.
Cliche Yet Surprisingly Decent Being a Living Legend has its pros and cons.
"The pro is, well, you're a Living Legend."
"And that title, given his previous track record, epitomizes Robert DeNiro..."
"But when starring in yet another mainstream popcorn comedy, it's like John Steinbeck writing a Harlequin Romance..."
"But wait... this time around, something isn't missing."
"The collecting-a-paycheck DeNiro is replaced with a man so utterly stiff and endearing (imagine what his ailing character scolded Robin Williams to be more like in AWAKENINGS), he works despite being obviously created to win over both the audience and his tech female boss Jules, played by Anne Hathaway, running an online clothing company with a daughter and a stay-at-home husband; the latter as useless as DeNiro's 70-year-old intern, Ben, is utterly reliable...."
"Despite DeNiro doing the same mugging expression with his chin, constantly, he and Hathaway have decent chemistry, moving the story along..."
"Yet the plot isn't the stress of possibly sharing her company with a more qualified C. E. O., or melodramatic problems after work... mere afterthoughts compared to what Ben can provide, with his old school charm and wisdom, to help her out of the fancy yet disheveled canvas she's painted herself into...

For those (like yours truly) who miss ""the old DeNiro"" (ie young DeNiro in classic films); while he's not TAXI DRIVER or RAGING BULL, he effectively plays a gentleman whose been around the block despite the tract being somewhat cliche and predictable...

Trivia/Connection: Two actresses from the sit-com ALICE make appearances: Linda Lavin as a scene-stealing, smitten neighbor and Celia Weston (who replaced Diane Ladd who replaced Polly Holliday) as a fellow co-worker: And that show was based on a motion picture directed by DeNiro's then-cinematic partner Martin Scorsese."
Enjoyable and emotional in parts.
"7/10 Review: I must be getting soppy in my old age, because I actually enjoyed this movie."
"Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $200million

I recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies starring Robert DeNiro, Anne Hathaway, Rene Russom Anders Holm, Zack Pearlman and Adam DeVine."
Are you fuc#%&ing kidding me?!?!
I don't know what to say really.
I mean; what the f#$k was i expecting?
"I didn't know it was a Meyers movie when i started watching it but i would have eventually after suffering those poorly written dialogues, mostly at the end of the movie."
*/spoilers/* Precisely at the husband-wife scene right at the very end.
You know: that totally unrealistic conversation between to people whose arc was a fuc#$%ing and total mess.
But i liked the De Niro-Hathaway relationship.
"Wasn't not remotely close to save the movie though, but i liked it."
"So, that's it."
What else could be said about the movie?
"Anyway, Sorry for the excess of words here but i have to fill ten lines of text in order for this review to be considered as one."
May the force be with you all.
"""Good Comedy-Drama!"""
"Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway, Anders Holm and Rene Russo star in this 2015 comedy-drama."
"This story takes place in Brooklyn, New York where we meet Ben (De Niro), a retired, mild-mannered, widower who wants to keep busy and he gets a job as an intern for online fashion company, ""About The Fit."""
"Hathaway (The Princess Diaries) plays Jules, the company's CEO and founder who struggles with work and tries to spend time with her husband, Matt (Holm) and their young daughter."
"At first, Jules is a bit uncomfortable with Ben, but soon bonds with him and he helps her with her priorities."
"Russo (Showtime) plays Fiona, a massage therapist who works and finds romance with Ben."
De Niro and Hathaway are great in this and have good chemistry.
I recommend this good comedy-drama.
"Cute (Flash Review)

On the surface this appears to be a standard drama sprinkled with bits of humor."
"But it accedes basic assumptions by having an above average script, dialog and a couple twists and turns."
"There are even some very funny moments from some very strange looking and well-cast, side characters that help energize the story."
The plot is about a fast- moving tech company that hires some senior interns; not seniors in college but old retired people.
DeNiro's character may be slow with the tech knowledge but brings a wealth of life experience to the company and the young CEO who struggles to run a company and have time for her husband and child.
Amusement swirls around that dynamic.
"The movie is well-paced, decently developed characters yet does have a few weak plot moments."
"But overall, it was very entertaining and light-hearted."
"Great message, great story."
I actually enjoyed the movie a lot.
"It gives us a strong message to respect older people's wisdom and experience, and that it can be very helpful even in the today's tech world."
"The actors are absolutely brilliant, there's no one who could make Ben other than Mr. Robert De Niro, and Anne Hathaway plays a perfect Jules."
"The soundtrack is fine, the argument is brilliant and everything looks where it is supposed to be."
To me the only thing I felt was that those last scenes were a bit rushed and that they could explore those developments a bit longer.
"Other than that, amazing movie."
One of those who can be an opinion changer about older people's part in modern societies.

This film is much better than its rather silly premise will have you believe Bored with retirement 70 year old widower Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) applies to become a senior intern at a newly founded online fashion site.
Founder and CEO Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) has her doubts about her new 'applicant' in the early stages and considers getting him transferred to another department.
"However, she soon starts to learn that Ben is not only a good worker, but that he's also an excellent 'life-coach' whom Jules finds invaluable both as an employee and as a friend as well."
The start of the film presents us with a 'fish out of water scenario.'
Whittaker is a 70 year old man who isn't terribly familiar with modern gadgets and in how the modern world works in general (which sadly houses an element of truth the older you become).
"The 'fish out of water' stuff is amusing, but isn't really enough to base a film upon, but thankfully it doesn't just use this as a running theme in this film."
I think the thing that I liked the most about this film is that it felt more like a character study on Jules' behalf with Ben kind of being written around her character.
"She's presented as a hard-working, go-getting woman who basically lives and breathes business, but the film wisely presents her as a 'flawed' character; had she been some kind of superwoman with a wonderful husband and a dream lifestyle then it would have made the film feel shallow, artificial and not particularly believable."
"However, by showing cracks here and there it does perhaps highlight the highs and lows of wealth and success."
The film for me was a minor triumph because I found Jules to be a strong believable character and found her easy to identify with.
"Ben, to me, felt like the piece that was missing in Jules' life; he's an old wise owl who probably doesn't know an Ipod from an Ipad, but he's lived and he's more often than not on hand to chip in advice from time to time and at times he does make Jules see things from an alternative perspective."
"Whilst I did appreciate the warm bond that developed between Jules and Ben and I found Ben to be endearing, kind and likable I didn't find his character quite as believable as Jules; he came across as being a bit too nice and a bit too good to be true and some scenes in the film that bring him closer to Jules seem a little contrived; such as looking out of the window and seeing her driver swigging some alcohol and driving past and seeing Jules' husband having an affair with another woman."
"Yes it's possible, but incredibly convenient."
There are other minor issues such as some of the rather annoying 'hipster dialogue' which felt a bit forced and unnatural.
I could also have done without all of the ridiculous Apple Product Placement.
"On balance this film gets a lot more right than wrong and although the premise does present us with a somewhat ridiculous scenario, at the same time the content of the story comprises of many believable elements."
The bond that develops between Jules and Ben is quite heart-warming and even though much of it is predictable and elements of the story are a tad contrived it's a film that's very hard not to like.
"Female business power In The Intern, Robert De Niro plays an old, restless, retired widower who doesn't find his freedom from work particularly satisfying."
He finds a flyer about a position as an intern on a company that sells clothes online.
Anne Hathaway plays the young stressful boss ho reluctantly hires him.
"The Intern immediately feels a bit weird and corny, mostly because of an old man as an intern, but at the same time that's what makes it feel new and fresh."
It also shows a positive attitude towards the seniors in our society who usually plays oddball supporting roles.
"The story develops and we are introduced to Anne Hathaways family, who she never spends time with due to her job."
We also gets to know her personality and the problems she faces at work.
The interesting thing about The Intern is that we follow the story through the eyes of Robert De Niro's character as he sees it in the film.
The film's weakness lies partly in its length but also in the fact that many problems doesn't add up in a satisfying end.
"With its two hours runtime, The Intern feels too long for its genre and format."
It needs to be tighter.
"Also, despite its length I still doesn't feel like we are getting enough screen time on the important problems, like her family and her relationship to her husband."
"The Intern is still an enjoyable film and like I said before, it deals with an interesting topic."
"Not just because of Robert De Niro's role as an old intern, but also Anne Hathaway's role as a successful woman and the problems she is forced to deal with because of it."
It asks us important questions like can a woman have a career and still care for her family?
"All in all, a watchable film with something good going on, but it would have been slightly better with a little more post-production work."
"Still, it is enjoyable and I grade it 6 out of 10, because it was entertaining and it deals with a present problem in society."
David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se
"basic but pleasant Seventy-year-old, Brooklyn-based widower and retiree Ben Whittaker's life is an ongoing, relentless effort in creativity."

"he has a void in his life that he's desperate to fill, until he signs up for a senior citizen program at an e-commerce fashion startup run by Jules Ostin, a prototypical workaholic who's initially skeptical about Ben's ability to contribute to the business."
"The biggest criticism of this easygoing, feel-good comedy-drama from Nancy Meyers is that it's a bit too simple, perhaps even a bit too congenial for its own good, but--much like the lead character--it gradually grows on you, has some genuinely funny scenes, insightful themes, and makes the most of the unorthodox but effective pairing of De Niro and Hathaway."

Good Enjoyed this way more than I expected.
"Amazing movie The Intern is a comedy film, released on 2015."
Directed by Nancy Meyers.
"The main characters of the film are the Academy Award winners Robert De Niro (Raging Bull, Silver Linings Playbook) and Anne Hathaway (Les Mis√©rables, The Devil Wears Prada)."
"The film told us the story of Ben Whittaker (De Niro) a widower of 70 years old and a retired man, who wants to keep his life and mind busy, he travel, he learned new languages, he takes yoga classes, he goes for walks and tried his best to make a busy life, anyway he keeps feeling like something is missing in his life, like he could do more and be more."
"Until one day, he found an ad for Senior Internship Program at a fashion agency, he made a video to apply for the internship."
The agency hires him and his position will be assistant to the young founder and director Jules Ostin (Hathaway).
"The story keeps telling us how Ben develops at the work, how difficult is for him to adapt to a new age of young workers, how traditional he is but at the same time the energy he has and how much he wants to learn about everyone and help in anyway he can; the film also show us how free is Jules for work, how dedicated she is and passionate are for the agency that she created."
"The film show us how the relationship between Jules and Ben develops, how little by little they started to connect as friends, as co-workers ."
"It is an amazing film for me, the story has everything that a comedy should have, the music is amazing, the cast made an incredible work, the writers have created a beautiful story about a talented woman and how her life changed thanks to an incredible man who the agency gave the opportunity to make part of a work team, no matter the age."
"The film really keeps you exciting, it is very interesting, funny and all the film is awesome."
"If you want to stay at home on a weekend and watch an amazing comedy, you definitely should see this film, because you can enjoy it and don't think about anything else."
"If you loved Anne Hathaway on The Devil Wears Padra, you will definitely love her on this film and De Niro makes a terrific work on this comedy, very different to all the kind of movies he has made, but you will be surprised of how good he is."
Hope you liked as much as me.
Predictable I gave it a three because of Robert De Niro's quality performance.
Otherwise this movie is a one or zero.
The movie is grossly predictable.
Seems that zero thought went into the writing.
This movie may likely appeal more to women as my wife loved it and watched it twice.
Too much crying in the movie.
Too many clich√©s.
My gut told me to skip this one but my wife implored me over and over to watch it.
The movie is forgettable.
"The story line is not compelling, the characters lives are boring."
De Niro brings humor and the just plain high quality acting you expect from him.
His suits are nice as well in the movie.
"Anne Hathaway is, well Anne Hathaway."
If you love her in other movies you'll love this.
If you hate her in other movies you'll hate her even more after this movie.
"Oh, the little girl who plays Anne Hathaway's daughter in the movie is cute and genuinely funny."
"Ummm....OK If you're looking for a movie that has no point and goes absolutely nowhere, boy have I got one for you."
This one will have you scratching your head for days trying to figure out what you watched.
Was that supposed to be a comedy?
Light drama?
Romance?
Well if you ever figure it our please let me know.
I haven't a clue.
"Oh, and don't get me started on the cliches."
Older wiser gent.
Young co-workers who learn a lot from him.
Over achiever female boss.
Her confused cheating husband.
Super cute daughter.
"Well, if you want to watch it knock yourself out."
Me?
I gonna go watch some paint dry.
"Good luck......

Light entertainment.
Nothing more This is a decent film if one does not have unrealistic expectations for it.
"It is, more than anything light entertainment."
"Acting from the leads was good, and, well, it should be, from Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway."
"Sets, costumes, photography all fine."
No problems with the direction.
"Some previous commentators have taken issue with the various ""messages"" of the film."
"I thought it was just modern Hollywood fare, leaning left, of course, but not outrageously so."
"The criticism of Anders Holm's casting seems valid, as he was irritating, and makes one wonder what Jules ever saw in him."
I liked Christina Scherer as the harried assistant.
A small shout-out to Annie Funke and Wallis Currie-Wood in tiny roles.
"Coulld have been funny and nice, but it is too synthetic When a bunch of good actors get together just to make a buck, this kind of flick happens."
"I understand that in today's job market some young people are no good at most jobs, because they lack experience, education, ethics and what not, while older people lack ... an ability to cooperate with managerial idiocy."
"So, no one is any good for a job anymore!"
This movie demonstrates this job market situation clearly enough.
"Anyway, everything is made in china, so what can be done, right?"
"At the same time, whoever made this into a comedy had no idea that a comedy has to be dynamic, it has to have some actual ""funny things"", funny moments that most viewers would understand (ya know), and it has to relate to the public who watches it."
"Not too many people know of any ""business-ethic-less"" start-ups that actually last, so very few individuals could possibly identify their business experience with this funny company."
So this is neither associating nor funny.
"But MOST IMPORTANTLY, I do not know anyone who would act and speak so unnaturally, idiotically, uneducated-ly - you name it - as most characters in this flick do!"
Most of these characters do not seem to be able to form a spoken word without acting like mentally-challenged clowns.
"I mean, if some types act like this, it does not mean that the entire Brooklyn is a dumb circus or something."
"And what kills a viewer is the way how a highly experienced person who is in no need of extra income is forced to kiss up to some disorganized, mentally-problematic broad who somehow runs this great business!"
"A seriously business-experienced person with no need for money could ever bear any of this unnatural, ridiculous, disorganized nonsense."
"I am sure, for real, that this movie had been made by people who never found themselves in any sort of a business environment."
"Furthermore, as it is true most of the time, these Hollywood types keep making movies about Brooklyn, but they do not know what it is like and who inhabits Brooklyn!"
Poor attempt of depicting your imagined Brooklyn!
"Hollywood, you are making fools of yourselves more and more."
"Started entertaining then it went bad The first half of the movie was fun to watch, then the movie became a massage about how there's no real men anymore."
And then it became a massage of feminism and all men are cheaters and how a women should not care about anything but her own happiness.
The creator of this movie didn't know where to go with the original cute idea and in the end it was one big boring mess.
I did like the chemistry between Robert and Anne though.
They make a fun duo.
Go watch something else if you value your time.
I gave it a 4 because the first half of the movie is fun and the acting is solid for the main characters.

No Chick Flick or Romantic Movie but Cute Still It shows another side of the Intern.
"As they all come in different shapes, sizes, and what have you."
It is not a chick flick or a romantic movie.
But it is a cute movie nonetheless.
Robert DeNiro is Ben as he is a widower and grandfather who does not seem to enjoy retirement.
As he goes and applies to be a senior intern in the clothing industry despite not knowing anything about the high tech world.
But he wins people over and makes fast friends over his old school approach.
The building where he works there is a twist you have to see.
"There the boss Anne Hathaway, a working wife and mother whom is on the fast track to success."
"As she and DeNiro become friends, as he becomes a personal assistant and confidant."
Won't win any awards but still it is a cute movie!
"""The meaning of life is your career and your social ascension"" - not my kind of film."
I can't say that I didn't like this film.I really like De Niro and Hathaway.
But there was something about their characters and the values they promoted that I didn't like .
As if everything in life revolves around work and success.
De Niro's character had absolutely nothing to do with himself when retired (which indeed happens a lot in real life but this doesn't mean it's not sad).
I mean do people get so alienated from themselves they have no idea who they are when they are not working?
And they just can't stay in a room with themselves if they don't get some kind of social validation ?
That is really sad.
"As for Hathaway's character, being so ""private"" and suspicious is almost insane."
"But the worst part was the heart to heart the two of them had near the end of the movie, where he tells her that her career is more important than everything else and if her husband can't cope it's time she let him go."
Wow !
I'm not saying cheating should be excused but the focus was not on her husband's cheating on her during this conversation.
The focus was on her career and how that is the most important thing in a person's life and no one should be allowed to get in the way.
This is why I say I didn't like the values promoted in this film.
People reduced to financial and social achievement... not my cup of tee.
"An appealing inter-generational movie American writer and director Nancy Myers, a woman in her mid 60s, has made her name with a particular type of movie, such as ""Something's Gotta Give"", ""The Holiday"" and ""It's Complicated"", and ""The Intern"" fits right into that mould: tales of love and loss told from the a perspective which is that of a woman or older person or both, essentially comedic but with some wry observations and some occasional poignancy."
"There are too few films aimed at a maturer audience and, as a sensitive man of a certain age, I enjoy her work, but she is careful never to be too challenging."
"In this case, the female point of view is that of start up founder Jules (a delightful Anne Hathaway) who is struggling to have it all: a demanding job, a loving husband, and a delightful daughter (something's gotta give)."
"The perspective of an older person comes from a man, the intern of the title, Ben (a charming Robert De Niro), who is widowed and lonely (fortunately the lovely Rene Russo is on hand as Fiona the company masseur)."
"As well as her usual themes, Myers plays with some inter-generational issues especially around technology and work-life balance, in a work that is light but made by two eminently watchable leads (Jules has some great clothes and Ben is rarely out of a suit and tie)."
"Not as expected at all I watched this film last night on Sep 25th, the official release date on movies."
"I was so excited as I am a big fan of Robert De Niro, and always try to see his movies in the theater on the first release day."
"De Niro 's performance was flawless as always, acting as a real gentleman creating very touching scenes."
But the screenplay was not enough rich to make this movie worthwhile spending 121 minutes.
They could not use De Niro 's humor properly in creating funny moments.
The movie screenplay also had some weaknesses which i don't want to mention not to be a spoiler.
I did not like it.
Hope you enjoy it if you are determined to watch it any way.

The mentorship This film surprised me.
I didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I did.
"70-year old Ben Whittaker played by Robert DeNiro, in a role that would give Morgan Freeman a run for his money as the oracle of wisdom, becomes an intern in a seniors' program at a successful e-commerce company run by Jules Ostin."
Jules is played in a winning performance by Anne Hathaway ‚Äì the sort that Meg Ryan used to revel in.
What I thought would be a movie where the comedy came from an old guy confronted by digital technology wasn't like that at all.
"It's funny and there are plenty of clever lines, but it's also a character study on a number of levels: what it's like to be retired and still feel the need to be needed; it's also a look at relationships when traditional gender roles are reversed in pursuing careers and raising families."
What Ben Whittacker brings to the table is confidence tempered with humility and restraint.
"He is old school in manners and dress, however he becomes a calming presence on the technology savvy and live-for-the-moment Gen-Z's that surround him."
Having been in exactly the same situation.
"I was mid-60's in a large office where the next eldest was under 40, and most under 30, and I wasn't the boss."
"Often what we have going for us are communication skills, a bit of hard-won experience, and possibly an old-fashioned ability to spell."
"As Ben Whittacker realises, although he isn't completely computer illiterate, he is surrounded by a generation of people who seemed to have had computer programs inserted at birth; he even has to ask his 9-year old grandson what a USB Connector is."
"Jules Ostin has built a business from scratch and now employs 250 people, but it has entailed sacrifice; she is basically a very nice person whose success has far outstripped her readiness for it."
She is hiding real vulnerabilities as Ben comes into her life and slowly fills the gap left by her parents who have an uninvolved attitude.
This is a gentle comedy that really sneaks up on you.
"It's warmer and funnier than Nancy Myers' ""It's complicated""."
"It's also very different from the ""The Internship"" starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughan, which also dealt with the generation gap in a similar environment."
"Although ""The Intern"" has something to say about women and power, it's not rammed home ‚Äì all the points are gently massaged into the story."
"This is a clever, beautifully made film that does not lose you for a moment."
"DEFINITELY AMAZING Anne Hathaway is such an amazing & smart actress the way she chooses her roles is just incredible, also the chemistry between her and Robert De Niro in this movie is incredible, this one's actually really good and sensitive and sweetly smart, such an amazing film."
Amusing A lot amusing indeed.
A seventy year old man ( Robert De Niro does a great role) tired of being retired with no aim in life decides to stand as a candidate intern in a fashion online company run by a demanding woman.
He is accepted and and becomes the assistant of the company's owner and director.
"Being a nice, wise and helpful man he soon is in everybody's good graces including his director being not only useful for her in business matters but also her personal and private advisor."
They soon become friemds.
The whole story is told smoothly making a very entertaining slight comedy.very pleasant to follow.
"As far as basic comedies go, this is one of the better ones As far as basic comedies go, this is one of the better ones."
OK-- could have been -should have been-- much Better DiNero was flawless as usual.
Ms Hathaway-always a pleasure to see and hear.
Supporting cast was--good...
The story line was WEAK.
What else is new..right movie fans ?
??!!
Sure..it was crafted to be simplistic..a feel good movie..fine.
But why waste such great actors on mediocre material ?
perhaps Meyers originally did have some worthwhile scenes that were discarded in editing....Oh well..that's today's Hollywood..worthwhile meaty scripts are as rare as a 2$ bill -how's that for a fitting clich√©'?
"Wait-..here's an alternative storyline...she hires the CEO-they fall in love after a few weeks, then-- DiNero and his new GF become close with Ann and new BF-they get smashed-and stoned one dinner date evening and do an ""intimate open forum..that's four-um !"
"!"""
Dinero is declared the winner by 2 knockouts and at work they now call him ..yep..THE RAGING BULL !
Lighthearted fluff.
While watching this film my wife commented how depressing it was.
"DeNiro is a widower, living a lonely and routine elderly life."
"He claims to be happy, he just needs to fill that time with something productive."
He spots an ad for an internship for the elderly and gets the job.
"The job is at a cutting edge fashion upstart, run by the determined Anne Hathaway."
"She started this business on her own and it's now massively successful, which takes a toll on her family and her sanity."
"To make matters worse, the investors want a seasoned CEO to run the company, much to her disdain."
Can this new intern help relieve some of this stress?
To say I was surprised at this film is an understatement.
"I went in thinking I would hate it, but I was delighted."
"The film is cute and has heart, much of this is due to the performance from DeNiro."
"A man known for playing foul mouthed tough guys, plays a heartwarming old man trying to be relevant again."
"He had a job printing phone books for a living, talk about feeling outdated."
"Now he has to learn how to use a USB drive, something his nine year old nephew helps him with."
"Hathaway has a decent role opposite DeNiro, the hardworking woman who has no time for her husband, or her child, despite her attempts to make room for both."
The film is very pro 'working woman' and mentions this numerous times.
"As delightful as the film is, there is no real conflict."
"Sure she needs to find a new CEO, but that doesn't really play to the centre of the film."
"No conflict, no tension of any kind."
"Things just sort of always work out for DeNiro, he's a jack-of-all-trades type of character."
Need something done?
He can do it.
This goes to absurd levels when they literally break into someone's home to delete an email.
A very out of place scene.
"The film poses a few questions about man versus woman in the workplace, adultery and relevance."
A weaker third act and an even weaker ending hurts an otherwise good film.
The chemistry between Hathawary and DeNiro is good delightful and I'm actually glad to see him in a role that he seems to care about this days.
Pancakes .
"They're the best actors of their respective generations, but ‚Äì WOW!"
‚Äì you keep wishing that they could find each other in a better movie.
"Unfortunately, the results of that dramatic event are crushed by a resolution that nobody ‚Äì but nobody ‚Äì is going be happy with."
"Worth watching just for the home break-in scene DeNiro is a 70 years old widower who becomes (along with three other 20-somethings) an intern at a trendy online clothing retailer in Brooklyn, and Hathaway is his 20-something boss, obsessed with putting her career ahead of her family."
"Entire cast did well, and there were a few funny moments scattered throughout, but it seemed like a lot of the humour was toned down for some reason, and the film never really comes alive, remaining mostly subtle and muted throughout (except during a hilarious burglary scene)."
Even affair subplot seemed watered down and lukewarm.
"A lot of product placement too (Starbucks, Skype, etc) became distracting and annoying."

"Worst film of Bob's Robert d niro is the best actor of all time, and this is his worst film ever without a doubt."
Happy music doesnt make the film happy and the dialogs were terrible.
"If you are a fan of bos's, just skip this film."
"In a word...charming Like most of you, I did not make it to the movie theaters in September, 2015 to catch the Nancy Meyers ""fish-out-of-water"" comedy THE INTERN about a 70-ish man (Robert DeNiro) who goes to work at an Internet Start-up company headed by a a driven Millennial (Anne Hathaway)."
"It seemed that this film was just going to be another Robert DeNiro phone-it-in ""paycheck"" comedy and not worth our time."
"Boy, was I wrong."
"In a word, I would call this film...charming."
"Hathaway is charming, the other workers and Interns at the start-up are charming and DeNiro (believe it or not) is the most charming of all."
"Starring as Ben - a widower who is just withering away with inactivity and boredom who decides to go back to work - DeNiro shows he ""still has it""."
"His Ben is a strong character, as nuanced as one can be in this type of film and...yes...EXTREMELY charming."
"DeNiro most definitely is NOT phoning this one in - he gives it a very good effort (maybe not A+, but...) and it shows."
He is on screen for almost every scene and holds our attention throughout.
"Proving to be a worthy partner in this film is Anne Hathaway's driven Internet sensation, Jules."
She spars with DeNiro throughout and the two make a fun pairing.
Also joining in on the fun is Rene Russo as a masseuse (and love interest for DeNiro and Andrew Rannels as Jules' ass't.
"But it is the trio of Adam Devine, Zack Pearlman and Jason Orley that almost steals this film as 3 knuckleheads that work with - and are mentored by - DeNiro's Yoda-like Intern."
I almost would have preferred to see a film about these 4.
Nothing in this film is revolutionary or new and Director/Writer Meyers keeps it that way.
"It's like pulling on an old, comfortable sweater or a really well worn-in pair of shoes."
"It won't win any awards, but it is fun..and, yes...charming just the same."
"THE INTERN is now streaming on NETFLIX and AMAZON PRIME, if you are looking for a...I'll say it one more time...charming...way to spend an evening - look no further than here."
"Letter Grade: B+

7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
"Heartwarming, genuine and well executed All in all, I thought the chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro was some of the best I've seen in a long long time."
I kept forgetting that I was actually watching a movie.
I didn't want it to end because I didn't want to say goodbye to these characters.
I don't understand why some reviewers said there was no character growth.
Please read below to find out why I think there was.
This movie touched and transported me.
"For example, the scene where Jules and Ben are on the airplane laughing and having a good time together had me smiling without even realizing it."
I forgot that I was watching a movie and I felt more like I was watching two people I cared about.
"Also, the hotel room seen the two of them had me weeping."
"Who wouldn't want somebody to take care of them, feel genuine pride and concern for them, and offer them such a touching gesture which I won't mention because it could be considered a spoiler."
"But, watch for it."
You can't help but be touched by it.
I look forward to watching this film ever since I saw the trailers in the movie theater.
I could tell that it looked heartfelt and well written.
I expected it to be kind of a gag about the old guy trying to adapt to new ways.
It was so much more than that!
It was a character study and the characters I felt were three dimensional despite what other reviewers have said.
Other reviewers have said that there was no character growth.
I completely disagree.
Ben's character grew through the opportunity he was afforded by becoming the intern.
I don't think he expected to experience everything that he did by taking that position.
SPOILER ALERT: He did it just to ease his boredom but he got the opportunity to nurture and mentor his seemingly cold boss as well as find love again.
"Jules grew because through her relationship with Ben, things that she was feeling but had not admitted to herself became clear."
"So, I definitely think there was growth for these characters."
There are only three criticisms I have of the movie.
"One, the scene in which Ben first meets his love interest at work is a little juvenile in my opinion."
I think the only purpose it serves was to illustrate that Ben could relate to his younger counterparts regarding a universal topic.
"However, I felt the part where the camera focused onto the object of the scene could have been eliminated and more implied than direct."
We got the point of how he was feeling when she massaged him.
We didn't need the extra graphic reminder of what was happening.
I also thought the scene where the younger interns and Ben went to the mother's house seemed out of character for Ben.
It was a pretty funny scene but it seemed inconsistent with who he was.
I forgave it because it was funny.
The third criticism is that I did not like the husband.
We didn't really get to know him and somehow I found him extremely annoying.
Maybe it was his looks or the actor who was cast in that role but I just didn't care about him at all.
"A beautiful, touching, well-done movie that you will not be disappointed in."
A refreshing dramedy I viewed Nancy Meyers' The Intern last year.
"It had some comical lines, visuals, and it is always a delight to watch the talent of the gorgeous Anne Hathaway."
"The story is unpredictable, the acting believable, and the characters likable."
"Moreover, my moral thirst was quenched when hearing certain parts of the dialogue."
I will elaborate on this thirst quenching.
A widower and retiree named Ben (Robert De Niro) applies to be a senior intern at an online fashion business.
"Rather than sending in the conventional resum√©, he is asked to upload a video of himself arguing his competencies."
"Ben is wearing the conventional suit and tie in the video, and is clean shaven."
This is his appearance throughout the film.
"Ben lands the position, and ends up working directly with the female owner, the hurried, entrepreneurial Jules (Hathaway)."
"Like Ben's age of 70, his appearance is in stark contrast the rest of the men at the business, who are in their 20s and 30s, and donning hoodies, thick-rimmed glasses and facial scruff."
Ben also has a more masculine demeanour than those of the millennial generation.
"Jules' stay-at-home-dad husband, Matt, looks the part of the hipster sub culture, is soft-spoken, but very competent and busy as a parent."
"His fatherly role is an admirable quality, but at the end of the day, he is too tired to have sex with his bread- winning wife."
"(I would never be too tired for an intimate act with a woman that looks like Anne Hathaway) Matt used to be the bread winner, earning more money than his wife, but he stopped working so he could look after their daughter, and because he believes in his wife's ambitions and the future of her business."
"One day at work, Ben is staring out the window of what used to be his old office, before the business space was renovated and became Jules' production floor."
He notices Jules' driver swigging liquor from a bottle wrapped in a paper bag.
"Ben goes outside to calmly let the driver know what he knows, and offers to take over as Jules' driver."
"The man says he doesn't know what Ben is talking about, but eventually acquiesces, telling Jules that he doesn't feel good."
"This is admirable, and not to be confused the the silly white knight chivalry that permeates every facet of harmless situations."
"In this case, driving drunk is dangerous, so Ben's cool and clam, assertive expression of concern is genuine."
"One day while Ben is driving Jules and Matt's daughter around, he notices Matt entering a vehicle and kissing another woman."
"When Jules finds out, she is saddened, hoping that Matt's affairs were over."
"She forgives him, they talk it through and reconcile, and she agrees to have a CEO run her business for her so that she can be home more."
"Later, Matt shows up at Jules' work and tells her not to make the step of getting a CEO because of her worry of infidelity on his part."
"He steadfastly argues that his infidelity is over, and that Jules should make her decision with her gut instinct."
"The infidelity situation with Matt was thirst quenching to see, given the rise of women arguing that they cheat on their husbands because they feel neglected by their workaholic spouse."
"This is a situation where the traditional roles are reversed, with the man at home, and the woman at work."
Now we know why Matt was too tired for sex.
(I still wouldn't be too tired for sex with Anne Hathaway) I'm interested in what modern feminists think of this situation.
Ben's comments about putting on a proper shirt and tucking garments in are refreshing too.
"He's a masculine man, and he argues that one should dress to impress."
"His comment about Matt being a 21st Century husband was comical, but also very true."
There's a scene in The Intern where a the business's masseuse is giving Ben a foot rub that is very comical.
"A character walks in on this act, and we are shown the scene from his point of view, which looks as if the masseuse is..."
"In The Intern, we see the beneficial dynamic that a masculine man and a feminine woman of different generations can bring to business."
"Ben's traditional dress, chivalry, and masculinity brings something to the table, so to speak, and Jules shows Ben some the benefits of modern technology."
"One of the best comedies, dramas of the year."
"Good job, Nancy Meyers."
Entertaining for all ages Enjoyable film about a woman trying to have it all.
Disappointed about the storyline with the husband.
I really wanted her to kick him to the curb after dallying about.
Otherwise Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway were lovely and had great chemistry (friendly) onscreen.
Worth a rental!
"A chick flick with DeNiro = A good film OK, OK, sounds sexist, but the formula was chick flick (female makes good, makes you feel good)."
"Add in Robert DeNiro and you have a horse of a different color, or maybe I've been married too long."
"Really, this was a very good movie with and excellent cast."
"Anne Hathaway plays a good hard charging founder of an internet clothing line (About the Fit ) that does what everyone hopes their clothes will do when they receive, after ordering sight unseen, off the internet, ""FIT""."
"She cares deeply about her company, maybe too deeply, as we find out."
Hathaway has a family (a daughter and husband) that seem to play second fiddle to the company.
The husband is feeling so far left out of the marriage he is having an affair.
"She just needs to learn balance and have someone she can count on helping her with the company, enter the intern."
"DeNiro, the senior intern (as in age, & experience), is perceptive, too perceptive for Hathaway, and picks up on the familiar situation."
"His understanding, though, goes a long way to help the overall situation."
"Deniro, Hathaway, and all of the other cast have an excellent chemistry and rapport."
"I don't want you to think that I think DeNiro carried the film, but, the film was called ""The Intern""."
"That being said, DeNiro brought his whole experience to the table, but Hathaway played her part with heart playing the fast moving, fast talking, fast at everything founder of the company with aplomb, much like her character."
"I found the movie very refreshing, entertaining, and heartfelt."
"See this movie, you'll enjoy it!"
"A 7 is what a consider a good movie, 8, 9, 10s are reserved for GREAT sci-fi and action flix, after all, I'm a guy."
Lighthearted fun with unnecessary subplots First part of the movie has a really nice concept for a plot.
We have this retired phone book factory worker who has too much free time and he decides to become an intern in some company to feel useful again and fill the gap in his life after losing a wife.
The concept is great and it works!
"The movie is really fun and lighthearted, Robert De Niro has really nice chemistry with Anne Hathaway (and don't worry, there's no cheesy love story here, it's strictly boss - employee relationship which later on turns on into true friendship)."
"Cinematography is really nice and everything looks like a perfect comedy with a nice message...

That is until we meet Jules (Anne Hathaway's) husband."
From that point onwards the movie changes its tone a bit.
It becomes more of a family drama than a comedy with the message.
"And then we find out that the guy is cheating on her...

What do you think that strong, resourceful woman do about this?"
"She forgives him eventually of course, because what would comedy do without a happy end."
But is it a happy end?
This sends really wrong message to young people (for women - you should forgive adultery if the guy comes to you and swears that it's over.
"For men - you can stick your flesh missile in every female in your line of sight, your girlfriend will forgive you anyway)."
I also don't really like that all of the people seem to be rushing in everything that they do.
"They talk fast, express emotions fast, and they show the sad truth of careerism (that girl working for 14 hours every day, imagine how wonderful her life must be)."
"All in all, this is a really good heart-warming movie, with one or two unnecessary plots packed together."
CHEER!
- (9 stars out of 10) The stage curtains open ...
"Wanting to find purpose in his life again, retiree Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) applies for a senior intern position with an aggressive and ""happening"" fashion company."
"As fate would have it, he becomes the intern of the company's founder and executor, Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway)."
"Although she is skeptical and aloof at first, Ben's old fashioned ways and honesty win her over during a crucial time in her life, both professionally and personally."
These polar opposites soon find out that true friendship can come from the least likely sources.
"And that a handkerchief, when offered at a tender moment, can mean all the difference in the world."
I absolutely love this movie.
"It is down to earth, realistic and has a lot of heart."
"Anne Hathaway just seems to get better and better with each movie, and she is in top form here."
She was endearing in her role and convincing.
"Robert De Niro is ... (well, what can you say?"
"), Robert De Niro."
Always good.
The chemistry between he and Hathaway was spot on.
Completely believable and entertaining.
"Rene Russo was also very good in her supportive role as Ben's love interest, Fiona."
This is one of those few movies where everything just clicks into place and works on all levels.
It has its share of dilemmas and deals with them straight on ... nothing is slighted or made light of.
"All relationships were treated as important, as they should be - even the cute side story between another intern and Jule's secretary."
"It showed how anyone, no matter what their age or status, can have an important impact on our lives."
How we should take notice and appreciate them for what they do and who they are.
I highly recommend this movie.
It has become a fast favorite and I will be watching it again.
Robert and Anne at their best.
I just got back from the cinema theater.
It's past midnight.
I feel so moved and inspired by this film that instead of going to bed I felt like writing something about it.
"I went to watch ""The Intern"" with some reluctance, I admit."
Anne was the decisive factor!
Sorry Mr. De Niro but she is gorgeous and cute at the same time.
"Still_x0085_ They say that actors, lawyers and doctors never retire."
The older they become the better they perform.
Robert De Niro proved that.
"If not the best, one of the best acts of his life."
"So expressive, so emotional, so_x0085_ everything!"
"The combination of the ages, the development of the story, the whole concept of the movie were excellent."
"I haven't seen better of Anne Hathaway since ""The Devil wears Prada""."
"The couple, the whole cast, matched perfectly."
Fully recommended for all ages.
I give it 10 without thinking twice.
"Genuinely a ""Chick Flick"" in the worst sense of that expression ""The Intern"" is an exemplar of the concept of the ""chick flick""."
It's a term I've never really liked.
"I remember, back in the day, figuring that when folks talked about this, they meant a flick that lacked narrative integrity, or played it morally safe: Think of a room full of pillows: No matter where you fall, you'll probably be OK. And, if the writers and producers strew enough pillows around, they can release a ""safe"" movie where life might seem to deliver the usual slings and arrows, but it's all kind of bundled up, cozy and warm, and no one actually has to really suffer."
"No real rules are broken, no one comes up against a real heartache, everyone gets to be a hero, the mistakes made are cautiously hedged, the antagonists are dogs with rubber teeth, and the whole enterprise is swathed in a comforting blanket of by-the-yard innocuous teasing-the-ears-of-absolutely-no-one sonic wallpaper background music."
The Intern is this kind of flick.
Everything about it is totally careful.
"The filmmaker doesn't want anyone to leave the theater feeling even a bit bruised, even while it's supposedly weaving a tale of interpersonal relationships in The Big City, where in reality the baggage of life perennially breaks down the wagon of love."
"Now: All that said, the flick has some saving graces."
"It's always great to see acting professionals take direction very, very well and deliver the goods; and they do here."
Some of the humor is _genuinely_ heart-warming.
"I have to say it _is_ a sort relief to sometimes sit and watch a non-stop stream of happy, unflappable faces, on at-worst nominally neurotic characters, flit across a screen for a while."
"But, in the end, The Intern is ""safe"" viewing fare, and at-worst an apologetic for the long-debunked myth of the Happy, Self-Respecting Intern."
"Interns (and Temps, and... and... and...) are largely being ripped off: Don't forget that as you watch the flick."
"{{{side observation:}}} Someone posted a vid on YouTube entitled something like ""Tarantino cites 'The Intern' as one of his favorite movies from 2015""... and it's an obvious plant by a cybergrunt working for the production company."
"The keywords for the vid were set up to cleverly trigger Facebook's ""related items"" search, and FB postings related to this flick, or Tarantino, or H8ful Eight might cause this to pop up in your FB stream."
It's at least as dishonest as ad clickthru GIFs that look like system dialogs.
"Even in light of Tarantino's admission that he watches Kate Hudson flicks on flights, I think it's safe to say that he'd... well, not exactly *despise* The Intern, but would certainly see it as not having enough of a redemption payload to redeem the time spent watching something so contrary to the time-honored film narrative esthetics that molded his own career."
Has the power to make you happier!
Great movie The Intern was one of the best comedy/romance movies I've ever watched.
"This movie makes you wonder why it doesn't last much more, that's how I felt when it got to the end."
"It's touching, it's simple, warming, colorful."
"Anne Hathway always stunning and amazing at what she does, more and more movies I watch with her more I like her (and I'm a fan, haha)."
De Niro couldn't be more CUTE!
"He's superb in every single way, and his character in the movie, aaaah so cute!"
"I like to rate a movie for how it made me feel in the end, and this movie made me feel so good from the moment it started..."
"I was very excited to watch it because of the amazing review score (specially for comedy movies, which ar never too high) and I'm so glad I did!"
"Guys watch The Intern, it's the perfect family movie."
"A nice -- feel good film This really is the definition of a ""nice"" movie."
"When the performances and the concept are this good, sometimes nice is more than enough."
Everything plays out in a rather formulaic way and the resolution involving the marriage issue felt hallow.
"Yet, Deniro and Hathaway's characters were charming enough to make up for any shallowness."
I really did love the old school versus new age philosophy on display and wish they had featured way more of that in the overall story.
Seeing his skills pay off more instead of him just being a good guy would have been more rewarding and given the film more depth.
"In the end, heart wins out over the clich√©s and the movie turned out to be a ""nice"" way to spend two hours."
Corporate America needs free Labour This movie strongly promotes the meme of working for free as an intern (unpaid Labour).
"I cannot imagine that the older generation will willingly volunteer for menial tasks for no reward especially when they can actually help people rather than just sell crap for somebody else, so I can only imagine that this is just an end run at persuading millennials that working for free is ultimately worth it, because, you know, corporations cannot afford to employ you, or otherwise your parents are rich enough to support you while you ""buy"" an advantage over poorer people who cannot afford to give up their Labour for free!"
"It's interesting to see all the elitist assumptions that are propagated during the film, such as it's okay to take a seat in the back when it's your driver but when it's your intern you should make a pretense of sitting in the front!"
This film is worth watching provided you 1.
"Don't pay for it, and 2."
"Can view it cynically, and use it as a lesson in avoiding both corporatism and elitism."
"Still as the intern job in the film is related marketing ""fashion wear"" it should be no surprise that his position is unpaid given Labour abuses in this field are the norm."
"Still it's nice to give work to popular actors who need money, as opposed to young unload actors, while doling out trite, feel-good, fake-nice, trash."
Sarc.
"I have to wonder why this film is so popular given all I've said, but then the reviewers probably aren't the same people working in the garment industry or working unpaid internships, maybe the theme of the film is that America is a very class *unconscious* society where the poor can be ignored, or maybe there is no moral and the writers are simply elitist!"
"A rare Hollywood flick that is really lovely and enjoyable, but without being cliche and predictable How often do lovely uplifting films come round that are not about romantic relationships?"
This film does a wonderful job at looking at the beauty of a supportive relationship between an elderly man and a young woman.
It is a straight up Hollywood movie done in a conventional style but without relying on all the predictable tropes that make you roll your eyes.
"It works so well probably because the script is great, the characters are 3D and human, and they are brought to life with honest portrayals from Anne Hathaway and Robert de Niro."
Excellent acting.
Sweet story.
Thoroughly enjoyable movie about the value older members of society can bring to the workplace as well as the perennial issues of successful working women juggling work and family life.
"Yes, we're 'still having to talk about it'."
"The weaknesses of the movie are the saccharine sweet family scenes between Anne Hathaway's character, her husband and daughter (the kid was an excessively beautiful child and was clearly acting with the sole direction ""be sweet"")."
The overall effect was just too much.
The other big weakness was the ending.
"It leaves the viewer thinking ""so, what happened?"""
"The solution to the problem was glaringly obvious from the moment Robert DeNiro's character walks into the office on his first day, the movie seems to be heading in that direction, then he inexplicably plays hookie for the day, and ... nothing other than ""just breathe""."
Just ran out of ideas for a decent resolution at the end.
"A Charming and Heartfelt Tale of Unexpected Connection's ""The Intern,"" directed by Nancy Meyers, is a heartwarming comedy-drama that tells the story of an unconventional friendship between a retired widower and a young, ambitious entrepreneur."
"With its endearing characters, genuine humor, and insightful exploration of intergenerational relationships, the film offers a delightful and uplifting cinematic experience."
"The movie follows Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro), a 70-year-old widower who, feeling unfulfilled in his retirement, decides to apply for a senior internship program at an online fashion retailer called About the Fit."
"Despite the skepticism of the company's founder and CEO, Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), Ben's wisdom, experience, and genuine desire to contribute make him an invaluable asset to the team."
"As Ben settles into his role as an intern, he forms an unlikely bond with Jules, who is juggling the demands of her successful business and her personal life."
"Ben becomes Jules' confidante, offering guidance, support, and a unique perspective rooted in his own life experiences."
"Through their interactions, both characters undergo personal growth, challenging their preconceived notions and discovering newfound strength and fulfillment."
"""The Intern"" captivates audiences with its well-rounded and relatable characters."
"Robert De Niro delivers a standout performance as Ben, capturing the essence of a man who is both wise and vulnerable."
"His portrayal is nuanced, showcasing his comedic timing and ability to convey deep emotions with subtlety."
"Anne Hathaway shines as Jules, portraying a complex and dynamic character, balancing vulnerability with strength and determination."
"The chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway is palpable, elevating the film's emotional depth."
"Their friendship is beautifully developed, rooted in mutual respect and a genuine desire to help each other grow."
"The natural and heartfelt interactions between the characters create a sense of authenticity, making their connection all the more impactful."
"Nancy Meyers' direction shines in ""The Intern,"" as she masterfully blends humor and heartfelt moments."
"The screenplay delves into themes of work-life balance, gender dynamics in the workplace, and the value of mentorship."
"The narrative explores the challenges faced by both Ben and Jules, offering insights into the struggles and triumphs of different stages of life."
"The film strikes a delicate balance between lighthearted comedy and poignant drama, resulting in a rich and emotionally satisfying experience."
"The production design and cinematography in ""The Intern"" contribute to its overall charm."
The vibrant and stylish setting of the fashion company juxtaposed with Ben's classic sensibilities creates a visually appealing contrast.
The attention to detail in the costume design further enhances the characters' personalities and adds depth to the story.
"""The Intern"" also benefits from its strong supporting cast, including Rene Russo as the company's in-house masseuse and love interest to Ben, and Adam DeVine as a young employee who forms an unexpected friendship with Ben."
"Their performances add layers of humor and warmth to the film, complementing the central relationship between Ben and Jules."
"While ""The Intern"" is largely a feel-good film, it does touch upon deeper themes such as ageism, gender inequality, and the challenges faced by working mothers."
"These issues are handled with sensitivity and serve to enhance the narrative, making the film more relatable and thought-provoking."
"In conclusion, ""The Intern"" is a charming and heartfelt film that celebrates the power."
Clich√©d plot line that annoyingly produces a thoroughly enjoyable film.
Surely they are not still making films like this.
Do today's audiences really want pre-feminist stories about wise old men that step in to prop up gorgeous and successful young career women whose feminine foibles are not only career-limiting but funny too?
"Casting the wonderful Anne Hathaway alongside the venerable Robert De Niro is the only way a director can get away with such a vacuous and demeaning narrative, and annoyingly produce such a thoroughly enjoyable film."
"This charming tale rests on an age and gender inversion where a bored 70 year-old former top- rung executive applies for an internship in a fast-growing online fashion company, a narrative with playful echoes of The Devil Wears Prada (2006)."
"De Niro gets the gig, but only because of company policy against age discrimination; when he is assigned to assist CEO Hathaway some beautiful chemistry emerges that crosses age boundaries."
"There are many charming, funny, and touching moments as the unflappable ""senior intern"" settles into the chaotic youth-driven business space."
"If you are not amused by such ageist insights, much of the movie will be lost on you."
"The creatively brilliant CEO who admits to ""not being good with old people"" is disorganised and at risk of losing everything unless she acquires some strategic skills, which of course women don't have and men are loaded with."
The old versus new culture clash is one long clich√© expressed through baby-boomer work-ethic mini sermons offering fixes for the hipster's free-for-all work-styles.
"Its all mixed together with his cute efforts to learn Facebook, her adorably feminine bouts of self-doubt, her stay-at-home husband doing wife work, and other random themes that don't cohere sufficiently to elevate the film's achievements."
"But most De Niro and Hathaway fans are unlikely to be bothered by the clich√©s of this ""behind every successful woman is a wise man"" fable and find it an entertainingly likable film."
"Simple adn fun Very fun and quiet movie to watch, very relaxing and brings great messages."
Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway obviously enhance the film with their incredible acting.
"Ben Wittaker, a 70-year-old widower and is tired of the everyday life of retirement, and, seeing a job offer for senior interns on a fashion website, decides to accept it."
"The company run by Jules Ostin, an empowered woman who managed to create a large successful company on her own who, in just 18 months already has more than 200 employees, is tasked with hiring a CEO to help the company, even if the company has already founded it alone and don't need anyone's help, we continue to see as a ""young woman"" successful businesswoman very linked to the technological and modern world and a man well alienated from this they manage to communicate and create a great bond of friendship."
Fantastic film to see as a family or alone to clear your head.
What movies used to be A thoroughly enjoyable night at the movies is what you will witness.
Hard to believe that the actor who played the semi-psychotic Travis Bickle in 'Taxi Driver' is the same one who plays a wizened intern here.
"DeNiro shows his talents in what he doesn't do, he plays a 'less is more' type of nuance to his character and it works."
This movie also speaks to generations.
"Whether right or wrong, the movie seems to be siding on the superiority of generations past."
"People of a 'certain age' as the film divulges, are of little practical use."
"We are exposed to the minutia of humiliation as people repeatedly ask if they can hear them or remember what they've just said, because of course they're old."
"As the film goes on, perhaps the ways of old were not complete nonsense after all."
There is a solidity to all of the people on screen which ultimately comes down to people who no one will ever know of.
The details got taken care of so the actors could just act.
"Not much to do with the movie I guess, but I know what these anons do."
7/10 Does it stray far away from a by the numbers mid-budget dromedy?
Does it bring original and inventive filmaking and style to the table?
Does it look like I've seen before some of the scenes and even seen countless parodies of them?
Yes.
Good now that we have that clear I can open up and tell you how delightful and heartfelt this film is.
"And I will start by saying what I thought as soon as I started liking the film, which was the same as what I thought throughout and what I think is what makes the movie win: it is simplistic, but it dam well knows it is and has fun with it."
"There are just so many movies that try to be insightful, original or serious and end up shoving down your throat a version of facts that is pathetic to itself and its tone."
"Yet ""The Intern"" makes it perfectly clear from frame one that it know it is simplistic and by doing so you go along with it so much more happily and end up having the good time the movie deserves."
"Moreover being simplistic doesn't exclude the fact that you can be reflective, dramatic or interesting, obviously not to ""American Beauty"" levels, but in a pleasant and welcoming yet not to deep way."
It is so fantastic to see Robert De Niro actually commit to a performance 110% and his commitment truly delivers.
"This is in my opinion a great performance, he adds so much to his character and manages to make him totally believable and present on screen."
You really forget it's De Niro.
Hathaway isn't any less committed and whilst she isn't as good as her co-star she most definitely has her moments and contributes to the chemistry they have together.
On a side note this film is also shot remarkably well for the locations and situations it offers itself to shoot.
Peronally I always felt the movie to be hear felt.
"It has characters that it treats with respect and interest, it subverts some way too common genre clich√©s and ultimately offers laughs and drama genuinely for the most part and I was delighted to be carried away and have fun, other than take the occasion to lightly reflect on the more serious aspects of the film."
Now as much as it avoids some clich√©s it does fall into just a couple of gigantic ones that really undermine a part of the movie and take away some the joy from it.
"There are useless but fun characters and there is a very standard and unremarkable style that often lessens the importance of many events that still manage to resonate because of good writing and characters, but don't really leave a print on you."
I had fun and I would gladly recommend the film if you want to have a very light watch at the theater and not feel stupid or insulted by some of the other crap we are often served in this genre.
"This movie is amazingly made The story, comedy and humor with outstanding acting the movie was really awesome and good watch."
It shows how the girl managed family values and run the company at the same time.
Decent feel good movie I thought The Intern was a nice feel good movie but it wasn't anything to special I just feel like there are better ones out there and personally I wouldn't want to spend money on this so only watch it if its free to you in some way.
"A feel good film done well POSITIVES:

1) Robert DeNiro is fantastic."
He is so warm and endearing and this really shows the range of his acting ability 2) The film had me engaged throughout.
I was smiling throughout most of the film and then when the emotional moments came I felt them too 3) The character relationships between DeNiro and everyone at About The Fit really do warm the heart.
"His relationship with Hathaway really is a friendship of equals, but then he also adopts the father figure role to the rest of the interns and seeing them start to dress like him etc was a great touch

NEGATIVES:

1) The score sometimes ventures away from 'feel good' and becomes a bit too 'cooky' for me 2) If I was being really strict, the film could have been more streamlined without the romantic elements."
DeNiro's romance and Hathaway's romance ultimately wouldn't affect the film that much if they were taken out 3) A pet hate of mine is when films have driving scenes in which there is a blatant CGI background and the characters are blatantly not actually driving a car
I got a lot of lessonsüòå I've learnt how a gentleman should be.
"In the scene of Ben admonishing Matt, That was amazing because he did that without mentioning his affair."
I've also learnt that how to express our feelings and thoughts is really important from the scene that Matt visited her office to apologize for affair.
The point is whether we can impress them or not.
"Fun uplifting cross-generational film As a 60 year old guy, I related very well to The Intern."
"Robert Deniro stars a Ben, a 70 year old widower who wants a job to add something dependable to his life."
"Ben worked for a telephone book company for 40 years, and he misses that regular rhythm of life."
"He's got everything organized and set, except he's run out of things to spend his time on."
Enter Jules (Anne Hathaway) as the CEO of a startup clothing company.
"Her focused disregard to details of her life are startling, but she's so focused on making her company successful that she's unable to pay much attention to the details."
"In short, she's burning out because she's in a bit too much over her head."
"She finally starts noticing Ben, who gets hired as an intern to connect with older folks, and Ben has a lot to offer because of his strong experience."
"Ben can relate to everyone, young, middle, older aged folks."
He's your prototypical nice guy.
"It gets hilarious to see some of his interactions with his colleagues, and how he starts having everyone's back because he so has his stuff together."
Can he find fulfillment?
Can he find new love?
Can he save Jules from herself?
Go see the movie to discover if all this is possible.
My only complaint is casting in the form of Jules' husband.
"They chose Andres Holm, whom I never heard of."
His looks didn't match what I would imagine a match for Hathaway as.
"His acting was not strong enough, nor believable enough."
"Otherwise, very strong performances from the other stars."
The Intern should leave you smiling and hopeful.
I hope you enjoy this film.
ATF is Ready to Explode.
"Ben may have told Jules that she had something many people don't, that is big beautiful and exciting, and though he is right, what he has however, is something way bigger and far more satisfying; Ben had a full life, and that, is something even less people will ever get to experience."
"The Intern isn't perfect; some parts of it were abandoned without conclusions and nicely tied bows, while others were a bit out of balance with the message this film was trying to bring across, but ultimately at its heart, The Intern beats strong enough to incite warm and stirring emotion."
"This film is funny, it's fun, it's interesting and the chemistry between its stars were well worth the watch."
"Anne and Robert were great and Nancy Meyers is really proving herself to be quite a fascinating story teller of love, life and its complications."
"The main characters were pleasantly presented and well handled, while the core of the story still managed to shine through, and not only is that important, but it also demonstrates talent."
"Again, The Intern isn't perfect, but it is solid."
7.1/10.
One of the best of 2015 I was expecting a good movie.
It is DeNiro after all!
But I did not expect to be as entertained and delighted as I was.
"It was cleverly written, dialogue that was perfect for the setting and the ages of the stars."
"The movie told a real story and didn't sensationalize by violence, sex or foul language."
As a newly retired person I was definitely able to relate but the story of the young folks starting out in their careers is something other age groups in the audience can relate to.
It was poignant at times.
I laughed.
I cried.
"I cheered, well inside my head."
"The outstanding performance of the newcomer, little Paige, shows us we will be seeing much more of her."
She is adorable as a movie child should be but really talented.
What a little treasure.
"There is much about relationship in this movie..between workers, lovers, friends, with yourself."
They were real people and someone each viewer can relate to.
"Be ready to belly laugh, weep a little, cheer for a favorite character, chuckle and be glad you saw it!"
"A terrible movie, not even rescued by good actors It is rare I feel strongly enough to write a review, but the fact that this movie gets a 7.2 makes me want to vent my frustration."
How it gets such a high rating makes me very suspicious of IMDb.
"The movie is weak, a very poor story line after the first 30 mins."
"Also a massive amount of advertising, a cynic would conclude the money involved in this movie 'helps' with the rating."
"The husband is the movie is very poorly cast, and Rene Russo it totally wasted in a cameo role."
The only reason this doesn't get a 1 star is down to De Niro and Hathaway.
"I'm not sure they need to be doing this sort of film, are times that hard?"
This could have been so much better.
It's not.
Just a little too twee Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro do their best and there are some decent laughs from time to time but overall it doesn't hang together with any real substance or credibility.
The best bits are the Interns interactions with his co- workers.
It might give you a semi pleasant distraction for a while if you don't really think about it.
What is De Niro doing in this movie?
The Intern - A Movie Review.
"Robert De Niro's place in the Parthenon of great movie stars would be secure if his career played in reverse; starting with 'The Intern' moving through 'Meet the Parents', 'Analyze That', 'Heat', 'Raging Bull', 'Goodfellas', 'Casino', 'Taxi Driver', 'Godfather II' and 'Mean Streets' to name but a few of his roles."
"Unfortunately, we can't reverse time, so now face the threat of his place being lost by an appearance in 'The Intern'."
"I'm not going to bother with a spoiler alert, because the plot of this film is so predictable you could see everything that was coming; nice soft-spoken retired widowed guy works for nasty dot-com business bitch-lady, who has cheating mister mum house-husband and beautiful daughter."
"He helps save the business, gives everyone advice on relationships, hooks up with the firms hot, but mature, in-house masseuse, whilst introducing all the nerdy geek guys around him to the benefits of carrying a handkerchief."
"Now, don't get me wrong."
De Niro acts well and is engaging in the role.
"There is even a small homage to 'Taxi Driver' as he repeatedly practices eye-blinking in front of a mirror ""You looking at me"" style."
"However, what is the man who manifested Travis Bickle, gave us a young Vito Corleone and channeled Jimmy Conway, doing in this formulaic fluff of a movie."
"I was prepared to forgive him for 'Meet the Parents' because it was mildly funny, although 'Meet the Fockers' stretched that forgiveness to near breaking point."
With 'The Intern' I can only assume he needs the money or is fulfilling some hidden contractual obligation.
"Either way we can only hope for a return to more gritty roles, although his next release entitled 'Dirty Grandpa' suggests otherwise."
The Intern The Intern is nice movie I've ever seen.
This movie tells that working is full of enjoyment.
The title of this movie says 'Experiences never get old'.
I think this words push people who feel difficulty or anxiety with job.
"70 years old man helps his boss many times, but he doesn't show off his talent."
"Although it is different from real world, its position like him gives hope for young worker."
And this film show that difficulties of living with partner or family comfortably.
"For men, women should work in house harder than at office."
I can read the fact by watching The Intern.
"This film has many aspects about life for example, work, marriage and raising baby."
I recommend The Inten for people who does not start working.
"A classy mature, feel good film, full of laughs and heart warming moments."
D'Niro and Hathaway have amazing chemistry.
"Being a gentleman, having true class, women empowerment, how life doesn't end after a certain age and how to deal with real life relationships are all things a film like The Intern deals with."
"I mean for me the film really didn't have any negatives other than the place slackened a bit towards the end

Overall The Intern is not a pathbreaking film, but the film truly lived up to its amazing trailer.Its nice to see a film deal with real life situations, in a beautiful, light manner and not be so serious and sad."
Watch it if you think Snow White is a real story I'm sure a lot of people will feel good watching it but in the real world it's just not realistic.
Will make people who want that I want to be in love feeling and the I want that life Hathaway has will certainly like the movie.
Truth is life is mean and more like a Rocky Balboa movie where you get knocked down by life itself but you have to get back up and fight to get any recognition in the world.
5 minutes in and I forced myself to watch the rest of the movie.
Painful and predictable.
Good luck to those who rated it higher than 2.
As it seems to be a rip off of the Devil wears Prada with a lot less aggression.
"a heartwarming and wonderful movie Exactly the kind of warm and fizzy comedy one might expect from Nancy Meyers, The Intern is a low-key, enjoyable piece of work with a likable cast."
"Suitably funny and boasting notes of capable melancholy, the film easily entertains even if its charms are not long-lasting."
The Intern is light-weight and enjoyable.
"With its well-placed leads, handsome aesthetic, and charming sense of self, the film easily appeals."
"It may not necessarily stand-out, but The Intern makes for a pleasing experience."
"Excellent Movie This movie is perfectly touching, heart warming and just beautiful in its way."
"Since his first appearance, Robert De Niro captured my heart."
He plays the gentleman we should see much more often in life.
"Strangely I've never watch any other movie with a ""gentleman"" being played so naturally and believable as he did, now that I think about it."
"And my praises go to Anne Hathaway as well, she practically shone in the movie."
"Her presence made the whole screen glow, I'm star-struck."
"Her portrays of the character of a successful businesswoman with her struggles (without overdoing it) in balancing family and work issues is so believable, it's just so natural and real and many can connect with."
It's pretty obvious that I love the movie.
I can see myself watch it over and over again in the years to come.
in a galaxy far far away...
In a galaxy far far away... a.k.a.
"the Intern's universe, everyone is a kind, caring, lovely, wise, good willing, hard working, great person, moral compass, with a permanent smile on his/her face."
"Don't get me wrong, I like movies that show the bright side of life and are positive and all, but even in fairy tales there are some dark moments or some kind of villains."
But this movie is flatlined!
Everyone is a sweetheart and apparently New Work is a great - sunny - clean city full only with happy pleasant people.
"Among them, standouts De Niro's Ben, who is not only a spotless person but apparently some kind of a super hero who at the age of 70 can work long hours, be there for everyone, keep solving all kind of crises while keeping clean and tied up a lovely home and have a relationship with Rene Russo."
"Half of the movie, I was honestly expecting the dark secret to be revealed."
Ben is an alcoholic?
a gambler?
he had a dark past?
he has some naughty vices?
something ?
anything?
nope.. nope nope...
He is just perfect!
"I am by nature very optimist and I believe than every person can be a good one, I have been even accused as laughing to much."
"But even for someone like me, this movie really tested my joy/happiness/utopia limits."
"In conclusion, if you want to have a getaway into a world where people apparently only die from happiness and joy, you will love this movie."
Heartwarming film I really enjoyed this film.
I like the concept and it is definitely something that should be done more to keep older people feeling connected to society and not alone.
It was a really heart warming film and I really liked the development of the relationships in this film.
Definitely worth a watch!!
A very good film I enjoyed every minute of this well made and very well acted film.
"The script, while not earth-shattering in originality and surprise, is tight and solid, with a little additional je ne sais quoi here and there."
"De Niro delivers a nuanced and wonderful performance, as is Anne Hathaway."
He is very believable as an ex top-executive that is very modest and helpful no matter the chore.
You feel he has much more to offer to anyone willing to ask for business advices.
"Hathaway in the same way, I found absolutely believable both as a super-woman-high-energy-startup-founder-and-ceo, and at the same time fragile and at risk of being crushed."
She is so charming and so classy.
"She does not strike me as one of Hollywood's top beauty, but she sure sparks on the big screen and must be a dream for fashion designers, as everything she wears looks outstanding."
The film also benefits from superb supporting actresses/actors such as Rene Russo.
"In short, I would recommend this film to anybody wanting to enjoy a good, intelligent story, free of car chases and explosions, but full of nuanced and great performances."
"First of all, I am a huge Anne Hathaway fan."
"That said, I loved this movie!"
The juxtaposition of Robert De Nero with Anne Hathaway is charming as well as surprising.
De Nero's character could have been a patronizing know-it-all after 40 years in business but he wasn't.
"Hathaway's character could have been a patronizing tech-savvy bitch, but she wasn't."
"Instead, this unlikely duo made things work."
"My only quibble with the movie was that the main problem of overloaded micromanaging Jules was not fixed, only calmed by Ben's presence."
"She still is not having a family life, not having enough hours in the day to do all she wants to do."
"The good-feeling ending was not a solution, only a smiley face band-aid."
As long as there' s De Niro... De Niro really is special.
He has deservedly been labeled one of the true greats in cinema history.
"Of course a movie like ""The intern"" does not do justice to such an amazing actor, but still, it's enough to show that when he wants, ha can also play a role that would considered easy and make it look dead easy."
"The movie is not memorable by any means, but it's perfect for a Sunday afternoon."
"In fact, the reason I am typing this review is because I did not find another similar movie to watch.Yes, there are hundreds of comedies released every year, but very few are catchy enough to get your attention."
"Maybe, it was the name of the movie that did it, for me, I'll just say this: please give De Niro more movies to act on."
Strong 7 I'm very close to the prestigious 8 on this one.
De Niro was outstanding.
The movie moved us in uniquely 2015-era ways: old-school businessman endorses young working woman's career and becomes her confidant both personally and professionally; working woman deals with stay-at-home dad's infidelity.
And older widower finds meaning and potential love in retirement and singleness.
The movie clearly tugs at our heartstrings and we willingly go along.
"The theme music was taken from a dozen similar movies, but gave it a vintage feel and served the movie well."
The last 2 minutes were odd.
It's hard to end a book or a movie well.
About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.
"My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good."
"My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very Good."
Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding.
Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A Classic.
(Less than 2% receive this rating).
"Ambivalent I went into this movie blind...I had no idea or expectations, just killing some time."
You figure Bobby has rarely let you down so; what the hey?
"I read the first few reviews of the ""loved it"" sect and then went to the ""hated it"" section...The Hate it section was hilarious!"
"Watching them come up with analogies, which were not as clich√© as the movie, thus destroying most of their points was stimulating!"
"Those that loved it, I can see why...It's a nice safe story and filled with decent people...Nothing untoward...

On to the movie..."
"I give a 5 because it had some heart but...Just enough heart to give you that ""meh"" feeling."
"It seemed miscast for some reason...The daughter too precocious, the business woman too driven; the husband (blech, what a nudge!)"
"Bobby, consummate pro, although his face always seems to be frozen in that ""You talking to me?"""
grimace...This would make a great TV series on like; TBS.
They could flesh it out some more...
If I had a list of 1000 decent movies; This would be about 931 on the list.
I just know there's a hole in my life and I need to fill it.
"This film is obviously not a flawless, riveting masterpiece."
"But sometimes, movies should be straightforward, light-hearted and sympathetic without having deeper, mature themes."
"Subjectively, I simply adored the basic premise of a widower filling the void in his life and showing the new generation of the old one how to do things."
"Add to that that the movie is set in New York, which I always appreciate."
Robert De Niro is brilliant as a thoroughly likable and gentle intern.
I liked it.
It was a pleasant surprise.
"On a more trivial note, how unconventional is it that Quentin Tarantino named this movie one of his favorites of the year it came out?"
"Read the synopsis and you'll have seen the film I was hoping for something more risky, but what I got is a paint-by-numbers feel good comedy."
It tried to have more carnal humour (happy ending massage part etc.)
but they fell short as it was not in tone with the rest of the film.
"If you read the synopsis of the film, you pretty much get the gist of what is to come."
"Generation v generation jokes and dilemmas, stereotyping all old people as useless etc."
Nothing special or new - just a feel good film where both protagonists learn and grow.
The issue I had with it the most was that everyone was so understanding and picture perfect.
Perfect speech.
"Perfect responses to crises in their lives (you know, when your husband is having an affair this is an opportunity for you to be level-headed and learn something about yourself)."
Perfect clothes.
Perfect teeth.
"Etc., etc."
A bit too polished everywhere.
Tonnes of product placements - helps with boosting that profit margin.
"In my mind it could have been way shorter, and thus more effective, more punchy."
"There were moments that it was touching or well acted etc., but overall it was nothing special."
"The tone felt like a TV movie you'd see on Sundays' at your grandmothers, somehow backed with a big budget."
"Nothing much to see here, unless you want to run it on in the background whilst making Sunday dinner."
Chappy Watched: The Intern I hadn't really heard much about this film or really seen any trailers but there wasn't a lot on to choose from so we thought we'd try this.
How bad can it be?
It Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway!
It's not bad at all!
This film was a complete surprise and even made it's way into my Top 10 for 2015!
It's well written with the laughs and the drama flowing beautifully together as well as seeing the generational differences between the two leads.
Speaking of Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway; they are brilliant together as well as with the rest of the awesome supporting cast members.
"There's plenty of drama, romance, laughs and just plain entertainment to be had with this film."
"But_x0085_

I'm not a fan of the ending, it feels like maybe there wasn't a clear idea on how to end it and it felt rushed."
"A great film to watch, even if you don't happen to be a fan of any of the cast or even have any idea of what the film is about."
CHAPPY THINKS any place that gives their staff free massages is worth not getting paid!
Clich√© and boring I wasn't a fan.
Fell asleep multiple times.
"Lots of clich√©s, bad child actor (sorry, but im just being honest)."
The husband portrays all the stereotypes of a stay at home mom/wife which just made me cringe.
Doesn't acknowledge the misogyny that causes these stereotypes to happen.
Robert Dinero is great but the character's quirks are tiring after about 10 minutes.
"Charisma of Robert de niro While seeing the trailer at first ,thought ending Anne Hathaway will have a romance with Robert de niro after her husband cheating.its my wishful part of thinking cause Robert De Niro show the right attitude and charisma in the workplace that every women will like him.too bad it's didn't happen.Overall, It's a fast pace movie that I find it's happen too fast that I haven't recover from my first feeling then come another one.wish it's will be better if add another 30min of it."
A heartwarming-style comedy drama A man finds his true passion after his retirement from a phonebook printing company despite his passed-away wife included.
The Intern Review The Intern is a film written and directed by Nancy Meyers.
I had just heard about the film being a good one.
I saw no trailers so I didn't know what to expect out of it.
"After the film finished, I was satisfied."
It's basically a slice of life kind of film.
"Plot: Ben Whittaker, a 70 year old, joins as an intern to Jules Ostin in an online fashion company."
Story and Direction: The story is quite simple.
"We have a man, old and alone, having to do nothing basically, joining as an intern to just make himself busy."
Now that's something an old man always faces which is very beautifully shown here.
"Then we have a contrasting character like Jules, who is very busy and doesn't have the time for almost anything (today's working women)."
Both of these characters are balanced quite nicely.
We also have certain characters of the office which are quite enjoyable.
"Also we get a sneak peek into Jules' home where she has a husband and daughter, for who she feels she is giving less time due to her job."
The most of the story is perfect.
I had issues with some things.
Like Fiona the massage therapist.
"Although the character was very little, but still, trying to make Ben and Fiona a pair was kind of making the story go off track."
Another thing was the office people helping Jules in one scene of a mistake made by her.
"I mean, don't we say we should keep our personal and professional lives separate."
Performances: Robert De Niro is a great actor and its always a joy to see him.
Anne Hathaway was also good as the working woman Jules.
Rene Russo as the therapist was also good in her small role.
Adam DeVine as Jason was good in his comic portions.
Zack Perlman and Jason Owley were good too as Ben's colleagues.
Anders Holm had a sincerity in his role.
Favorite Scene: I guess it would be where Jules helps Ben open up a Facebook account.
And Ben in turn tells Jules about his work.
This was basically where I felt the essence of the film lied.
The older and newer generation sitting and talking and sharing ideas.
Verdict: I had a great time with The Intern.
It was a good film.
Robert and Anne were great in their roles.
"Although a few missteps, but the film is still watchable."
I am giving it an 8/10.
Oh my Goodness- zzzzzzzzzzz fest Oh puleeaasseee this movie sucked so bad I had to turn it off!!!
"Poor Robert D. bad bad acting, horrible script, such a stupid movie but that's what Hollywood is now - full of bad actors and writers!"
Skip this one!

Brilliant Legend for a reason.
The movie is short sweet and so touching.
Such a breather.
De Niro Sold the Story!
"Robert De Niro was so likeable and wise in this movie, it made me go awhhhhh!"
I've seen loads of De Niro interviews and his face says it all.
"I don't want to be here, I don't want to answer your questions, when will this interview be over , etc, etc."
"Watching so called STARS be interviewed begrudgingly, is starting to really grate on me."
"If you want to peddle a movie, stick your game face on for a while, you get paid enough!"
"If you are tired of giving interviews, then we're just as tired of listening to your uninteresting, stilted, painful, one word, boring answers."
"Better still, don't go to the interviews, no one wins De Nero."

"Started off entertaining but got boring fast I didn't expect much from this movie, and I guess I got what I expected."
The synopsis seemed somewhat interesting and original so I was willing to give it a shot And for the first 30 minutes or so I will admit I was engaged and interested in how the story would develop.
Robert Deniro's character was highly endearing and I would have been more than happy to watch an entire movie focused entirely on him and his story.
Deniro delivers as usual as I truly believed him in the role and rooted for him throughout.
Unfortunately most of Anne Hathaway's scenes felt forced and her story - although intriguing at points - was not entertaining enough to keep me interested.
"Although the two leads worked well together, the story was not enthralling, adventurous, or even comedic."
By the halfway point of the movie I was ready for it to be over.
Better than what I expected.
Incredible first-half.
Disappointing second-half Interesting movie about superation.
Awesome premise about a man fighting ageism in a modern and young corporation.
"Too much potential, but the movie went downhill at second half, focusing too much at the 'rich fiel problems'."
Disappointing.
"uplifting show, funny, showed a seniors choice to move on with his life The movie was funny, meaningful and a wonderful change to the blood, guts and gore which seems to be very prevalent in most of the movies today."
It was a movie which does touch home to a lot of our citizens being seniors today.
"It was a pleasure to watch and bring along my grandson, which I must admit he thought was a good show as well."
"We both laughed a lot, understood the predicament of the senior and how he captured the admiration of the youth."
We left the movie with a smile on our faces and felt that it was time well spent.

"An ""Intern"" in Life and Love Throughout history, I imagine many members of the human race have been gerontophobic (i.e."
afraid of old people or of getting old).
The movies often have a similar attitude.
"In them, usually, elderly or older people are anachronistic, out-of-it, narrow-minded conservative fuddy-duddies that need exposure to today's young whippersnappers to discover fulfillment and purpose."
"I thought the movie ""The Intern"" (hereafter ""Intern"") would fall into that condescending mold."
"""Intern"" stars Robert De Niro as Ben Whittaker, a 70-year-old former executive at a now- defunct (of course!)"
telephone book manufacturing company who is getting a teensy bit weary of retirement.
"He decides to re-enter the workforce, but what 21st century company would take a chance on a ""geezer"" like him?"
"It so happens that his old friend Patty (Linda Lavin) has a flyer from a fashion-clothing, wholly Internet-based business called ""About the Fit"" seeking participants in a ""senior internship"" program."
"Ben goes for it but learns he must submit a ""video resume"" as part of the interview process, which naturally sounds bizarre to his traditional ears."
"However, he submits a recording and is selected as an intern."
"Ironically, ""About the Fit""'s offices are located in the same brick warehouse building that Ben used to be CEO."
But now the space is filled with laptops and smartphones and young casually-dressed salespeople coordinating orders and deliveries.
"Can ""old-fashioned"" Ben, whose most technologically advanced gizmo is a tiny Samsung phone, get ""with it"" and carve out a niche in this growing company?"
"""Intern""'s ""surprise"" answer is ""Of course he can""."
"Despite a few expected faltering starts in using the new equipment and getting along with much younger co-workers like frantic lives- with-his-parents geek Davis (Zach Pearlman), tech-savvy Jason (Adam De Vine), and polite Cameron (Andrew Rannells), Ben's experience and professional, wise demeanor soon gain their trust and respect and help him advance."
"Still, at least at first, he can't seem to connect with About the Fit's founder and CEO Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway)."
"Put simply, she's the latest word in workaholics and is so anxious to expand About the Fit nationally, she rides a bicycle throughout the vast building to most efficiently keep tabs on her workers and make meetings she insanely schedules so close together."
"Jules was not even on board with the ""senior internship"" program (did she even approve it?"
She can't remember.)
and really doesn't want to deal with Ben (nothing personal) and even tries to get him re-located to another department.
"Still, Ben's work ethic and commitment make an impression on Jules as he becomes not only a reliable, valuable work consultant, but also fatherly ""life"" consultant."
"This is where ""Intern""'s title becomes (obviously) ironic."
"Ben is really not an ""intern""."
He's already led a full life and has his priorities straight.
"Jules is the true ""intern"", but in life and love."
"Her business has grown exponentially, but at the expense of her stay-at-home husband Matt and former engineer (Anders Holm) and her spunkily-cute, precocious young daughter Paige (JoJo Kushner)."
"Both Paige and Matt crave attention that Jules has no time to give, and Matt may be, shall we say, looking elsewhere to get it."
"Furthermore, Jules's critical, overbearing mother (always off-screen) keeps sending her snarky e-mails."
The demands of work and family are causing unbelievable stress and Jules is even thinking of ceding business control to someone else.
Can Ben point her in the right direction?
"""Intern"" is a gentle, calm, rather emotional, but life-affirming generational movie that re- assures us that older peoples' experience and wisdom never go out of style and, if presented non-judgmentally, can help younger people make informed choices on how to live a happy, balanced life."
"I liked De Niro's and Hathaway's tentative but adult, mutually respectful interactions and their discussions about her professional and personal future."
"I also liked the sprinklings of belly-laugh comedy as well, mostly involving company masseuse Fiona (Rene Russo) giving Ben an arousing massage, and a hilarious attempt by Ben, Davis, Jason, and Cameron to break into Jules's mother's home to retrieve her laptop and erase a really nasty e-mail Jules sent to her."
"Yet, for 52-year-old me, I especially appreciated ""Intern""s high regard for older people as personified by movie legend Robert De Niro."
"With his business accouterments, natty suit and tie (and ever-present handkerchief), and his quiet, rational confidence, he was a class act."
"We are all interns in life and love at one time or another, and it was gratifying to see Ben use what he learned from his ""life internship"" to help Jules deal with her own."
Couldn't get past the poor acting Too many cringe moments to enjoy the story.
It's like the script is trying too hard to fit into an agenda instead of just telling a story.
He is not obsolete This movie was a great story about challenges that a baby boomer may face in the work environment at a newly obtained position.
"Ben Whittaker, played by Robert De Niro, is a 70 year old widower who is trying to get back into the present world."
So he receives an opportunity for a senior intern position at an online fashion site.
"Whittaker was doubted at first, but his charm, intelligence, experience and wisdom quickly gained him the likes and trust of his coworkers."
"His boss Jules Ostin, played by Anne Hathaway, recognized Whittaker's work and slowly began to become attracted to him."
So their work relationship slowly turned to something more.
"There was some humor to this movie, but there was not much."
It was a great story though that flowed smoothly.
"Uplifting, entertaining and sophisticated The Intern is evidence that movies can comedies can be uplifting, entertaining and sophisticated without crude humour and corny moments."
There probably was an original script changed at the last minute First of all let me say that I l o v e Nance Meyers movies.
"They're mostly fun, romantic and have some good energy, with good quality actors."
This time we had the quality actors but the movie turned out to be a bit bland.
It became more of a Disney movie.
"With the script as it is, some more edgy humour is needed."
And for this Anne Hathaway clearly is being miscast.
"She is acting well but I don't see her bringing in some humour with the quality from the likes of a, like we had in the past, Goldie Hawn or, not unknown to Nancy Meyers, Diane Keaton."
But they are both too old to play Hathaway's character.
"A Tina Fey jumps to mind: perhaps she would have been a better choice, although she is also already too old to play a young and upcoming businesswoman."
"Then perhaps Lena Dunham would have been the best actress to play this part, but then Robert De Niro would most probably not have been right opposite Dunham."
"So with the script as we know it now, with some fun, little bit hysterical humour, the character of Jules Ostin would have had some more emotion and depth."
She would have been more fun for us viewers to engage with and more interesting to watch.
"Now she was too emotionally childlike and too nice for a woman who moved mountains to create a hip and happening business and who is, because of this, hardly getting enough sleep."
"The Jules Ostin character stayed too clean, too perfect."
But it's not Anne Hathaway's fault.
I think she followed direction probably very well because she and De Niro were both giving off the same kind of vibe.
The script just has too many holes.
"Even a crafty, energetic comedienne would not have been enough, I'm afraid."
"My personal guess is that the original script probably had some more edge to it, some more grownup relevance."
I think originally the 70 year old intern Ben and the 20 something Jules Ostin were meant to have had an affair and even a sexual fling in San Francisco after drinking some more alcohol in the hotel room from the mini bar (both already having had quite some wine in first class on the airplane on their way to SF).
"The two, in my assumed original version of the script, probably fell in love from the get go."
Creating some romantic tension between the two people from different generations.
"The affair of Ostin's husband would have been the reason then, for her to decide to act on the strong romantic feelings and the sexual attraction."
"Most likely, again it's my personal theory, somewhere along the line or Nancy Meyer or Warner Brothers decided it would be too edgy or too whatever."
"And they decided to go more conservative, for commercial reasons."
And then they came up with the Masseuse - some very nice acting by Renee Russo - to put in some real needed romance.
"But also the romance between intern Ben and company masseuse Fiona and the sexual attraction they feel for each other is missing depth, edginess and perhaps some heartfelt comedic realness."
Probably because the masseuse character was created at the last minute.
"Thus by failing to create a just enough three dimensional developing relationship between the two, they took out all the soul and fun out of the movie."
"I would have preferred the sexual tension and romantic feelings between the 70 year old and the 20 something year old, over the more edgy comedic option."
Because I also think that this was the original premise.
It would have given the movie some real adult relevance and the sub-title 'Experience never gets old' would have been way more multi layered in its meaning.
The movie would have also referred to the 1967 movie 'The Graduate' with the difference that now a young woman would be falling for an older man instead of a young man for an older woman.
With the intelligent light weightiness of a Nancy Meyer movie of course.
"The non sexual tension between young boss and old intern version, like it is now, could have worked but also then the whole script and all the dialogues would have needed to be completely rewritten."
Another actress and probably another actor should have been hired: more comedy for the young boss and then Ben the intern should have been more of a dandyesque character who had seen the world.
To make it all interesting for us.
The final version as we know it now probably was rewritten last minute and then they did not have enough time to really fine tune it all.
"It would have been nice to have seen some real love and attraction between the two main characters, for them eventually to say goodbye to each other, going back towards their old but renewed lives."
"It would have been a big adventure and life lesson for them as well for us, the audience."
Touching and endearing and very clever but overlong The powerful chemistry between the sagific Robert De Niro and the brilliant Anne Hathaway make this film.
With the great supporting cast and dialogue and the ever so cool contemporary cultural references this would be a 10/10 if not for a lack of editing.
There are too many irrelevant subplots making it sag a bit.
"But this is niggling as I found much of this both funny and moving and it works as an intelligent exploration of relationships, identity, purpose i.e all the important stuff."
Intern is a calibre production that engages us and earns at least enough loyalty to keep our bums on seats for 120 minutes.
"The Feel-good ""Intern""-ship into the Light-hearted Life A light-hearted, simple and a ""textbook"" film of-sorts on the independent lives of people in business, the age of e-commerce amalgamated with the philosophy of ""life in the years"" through the events of a retired 70-year old widowed man, returning to - as he called it - ""play the music, still left within""."
"What immediately strikes about the film is its ""good will aura"" through its smooth transition of scenes and the cool-coloured theme."
"Practically everything about it defines ""pleasantness"" - even in the slightly- pensive and troubling scenes, with a level of impact."
"A few surprisingly strong moments were those ""small-talks"" - an instance would be when De Niro during a post-work conversation with his employer Hathaway, tells her that their current work spaces were refurbished on the then defunct phone book factory where he worked for 40 odd years - and the very moment when Hathaway's eyes light up, one tends to feel the same apparent effervescence."
"The popularly fundamental elements of a drama-comedy (or any film, for that fact)- the Music (Theodore Shapiro, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty""), the Editing (Robert Leighton, ""A Few Good Men"" and ""Chef"") and the Cinematography (Stephen Goldblatt, ""Julie & Julia"" and ""The Help"") - are gigantic contributors in this wisely directed film by Nancy Meyers (""What Women Want"")."
"Although, a little ""too sugary"" on occasions, which seem artificial and redundant in some scenes, the film transcends on to a different level altogether while lightly touching upon the much debatable topic ""sexism at work"", subsequently phasing out with the experience (which ""never gets old"") and never- say-die human spirit."
"A problem risen, a solution delivered - the treatment was clear and distinct."
LIKABLE and a fine example of feel-good film of our times!!
really suprised by the high (7) rating...
"If you are looking for a boring, predictable and too long movie full of terrible cliches and written for rich, old and conservative people: here you are!"
Why does robert de niro participate in this?
Some parts are so awful that you cant stop rolling your eyes... definitely not to recommand.
"De Niro perfect, film is great but needs a bit more pizzaz Unlike most of today's movies, this one isn't full of clownishness and gutter jokes, which was VERY refreshing."
The characters seem like actual people that might actually exist.
What a concept!
De Niro's character is so beautiful that I wished he was MY uncle or neighbor or co-worker.
His character is a spot-on unassuming guru with understated rather than preachy wisdom.
Perfect.
"Calm and steady wins the race, especially when everyone else is freaking out."
Only changes I'd make would be to evolve past using any foul language (which is witless) and I'd spice things up a bit.
There are moments that seem slow or a bit too melodramatic.
I also would have liked to see more of Linda Lavin (one of my faves) since the first meeting with Rene Russo was a bit creepy.
"Funny, but creepy. "")"
countering the common criticisms The film is being dismissed as 'light comedy'.
That is selling it short.
"Lightness of touch, otherwise known as subtlety, is not the same as insipidity, which is what a many reviewers are saying or implying is the case here."
"The absence of explosions/shootings may have something to do with some reviewers' feeling somewhat at a loss, but like immature people they are quick to blame the film on this rather than look to their own perceptions or deeper into the material at hand, which is plenty rich."
"Fourbytwos over the head are not always needed, especially with an older, more experienced audience."
"Fault has been found with the soundtrack, which also lacks explosions and has been felt to be anodyne."
"Again, no fourbytwos."
"The director respects the intelligence and wisdom of the audience and does not belt them over the head aurally with cues to emote NOW and NOW, THUS."
This lack of overt guidance is too much for some.
One reviewer complains about gear shifts and intolerable thematic justapositions (comic heist/workplace sexism) and unexpected plot shifts.
It seems the 3-act play has built itself into the cranial boneage of some people.
"They're the lovers of Johann Strauss and never Bartok, of meat and 3 veg, of everything familiar."
"Interesting that the lack of violence, extremity and bangs and crashes in general in The Intern is problematic for them while at the same time they don't cope with a little play around story structure."
"This is how desensitised we've become in one direction, while remaining absolutely reactionary in another."
"Just like some teenagers, mistaking costume variation (to limited degrees) for radicalism."
"Older audiences will recognise the themes and challenges to the characters in the film, and the pains they bring."
Enough said.
And now focus on the wisdoms that are displayed here for the picking.
They are many.
Just wholesome all the way through The chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway in this film is really amazing.
I can feel Ben (De Niro's character) slowly becoming some kind of a father figure for Jules (Hathaway character).
"I also love the approach given where Ben is portrayed as a very humble worker who understands his position as an Intern, despite of his 40 years of working experience."
"He is willing to adapt with the youth environment, erasing the stigmas on elderly hating the youth."
Kudos for the writers to make such an amazing characters and making no useless conflict in the movie.
"However, there are some things I wished were explored a little bit further."
One of which is the relationship between Jules and her parents.
"It seems like they do not have a healthy relationship, and."
I just feel a little closure on that would be amazing for Jules' character arc.
"More or less, really love this movie and how wholesome the movie is."
I must have been aww-ing at least 50 times while watching this movie lol.
"I hated the script The cast is amazing but the movie turned out just bad.The script was too realistic and not in a good way, this is how conversations in real life goes (kinda) not movies, it was weird watching them talk and interact something was so off about it."
I think this is the worst performance from de niro.
Predictable OK I was really looking forward to this movie.
I love DeNiro and Hathaway and they were cast well.
The story starts out well - 70 yr old needing something to do with his life other than travel and play golf.
Founder of a company forgets she is going to have an intern - busy with a growing company and trying to have it all at work and home.
The story line of the relationship between the two main characters is well done however I would rather have seen a possible takeover rather than the marriage falling apart.
That part of the script was not handled well - this CEO would have handled it differently and I really do not think she would have been the sheepish woman she was presented as.
SO for me 80% of the movie was predictable and OK - the rest not so great.
A good enough afternoon get away but not a great movie.
Overly Stereotypical And how is this even a good movie?
"Here is an older man telling a younger generation of people how to live life and succeed and without his ""wisdom"" the whole company would fold."
"This movie is just awful

"Whyyyy In general i liked the movie, is a good one when u dont want to use your head for anything."
I actually watched this at my manicure's salon.
"TWICE

The only think that bothers me is the ridiculous attemps of throwing in some nonsense sexual implied scenes... that really didnt have to be there, it just didnt make sense, and it was very cringe to watch."
"Apart from that, its an alright movie, no hard feelings."
Whatever.
did a toddler write this?
"This debacle was at least 1 hour too long, for the middle school script.I'm still not sure there was a point to the movie."
"The ending came mercifully too late, and if that was an ending, the viewer has no idea."
Other than betting heavily on the Seahawks...I cant imagine why Robert Deniro would have anything to do with this horrid hack job.
"the plot was so weak, so amazingly weak!"
Even the wife apologized for having set this destruction of a good evening into motion.
"honestly, the movie is bad on so many levels, it cant be over stated."
"unless you're really looking for a nap, or just had a brain tumor removed, this train wreck is going to disappoint!!"
"Just pathetic....

Feelgood movie Everything works in this movie.
The cast is doing a terrific job and the main characters have good chemistry.
So watch it for what it is; a feelgood movie.
It's no big drama or story that will keep you awake at night.
But it will make you feel good.
"Taste of old and new ""The Intern"" is a great ""feel-good"" movie filled with comedy, a laid- back plot, emotional heart-pulling moments, and it was an overall fun film."
"I am a huge fan of both De Niro and Hathaway, the two are highly decorated stars in the film world and their ability to create chemistry was worthy of applause."
De Niro at the age of 72 still has the same acting magic that he had in his younger days and Hathaway is an absolute gem in every aspect.
The film appeals to audiences of all ages with comedic quips that the older audiences can love and appreciate as well as moments that have young adults and adults laughing in their seats.
"Overall, I enjoyed this movie for a nice change of pace with all the action and diverse plot lines that Hollywood has been dishing out lately."
"It is nice to relax to a feel-good film with a highly talented cast simply enjoying themselves, as it seems."
Hits every clich√©.
"I was somewhat tricked into watching this movie, by reading positive reviews on IMDB, so I spent the whole 2 hours and one minute waiting for something funny, exciting or in any way uplifting to happen."
Nada.
"This movie is just a run-of-the-mill collection of tropes and clich√©s, set on a background of your usual feelgood music."
"Yes, Robert de Niro is always nice."
He's a good actor and a classy old character.
"Unfortunately, this is where this two-hour long advertisement commercial's (lots of very in-your-face product placement in this one) qualities end."
"Now, I'm pretty sure that a lot of people just like these two hours of head massage, but it's definitely not for me."
As for the humour that was expected to be seen: I couldn't detect the smallest bit of it.
Just one feelgood scene with strings and harp after another.
"De Niro as Mr Nice-old-man, Anne Hathaway as the stressed executive."
"First part, they don't get along, but eventually they do."
Who would have thought?
"Nah, really."
I'm not upset because this movie exists.
"It should, probably."
"It's just not for me, and, considering how I felt tricked into watching it by overly positive reviews: here's my overly sincere one."
"Calling all seniors, think you're done with work, think again!"
"Now here's a film that's guaranteed to bring a warming smile to your face, thanks in part to the masterful acting and legendary presence of one Robert De Niro."
"A wonderfully crafted film that shows that age is just a number, you're never too old to go to work, and I personally think the senior intern program is actually a novel idea (don't speak too loud it'll give our current government ideas!)"
"Anne Hathaway is a gem, a serious contender for future legend, just as her co-star currently is..., she embodies what it is to be head of a start up company whilst trying to be a good mom, a good wife and a good boss, never has a minute, barely sleeps, works more hours than there is in a day just to make a success of herself and her business."
"It felt like a classy, classic film even though it's still very new and will probably grow better with age..., I cannot really fault it and where I can I'd just be being picky."
"A subtle blend of the old with the new..., old school Ben (De Niro) comes into an informal modern and overly trendy e-commerce business wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase, whilst his co-workers are young and hip and haven't got an ounce of self-respect between them; just as Ben tries to fit into their world, the new world..., he helps his co- workers learn about themselves, learn some self-respect, and that the old ways are sometimes the best ways."
"The relationship that develops between Ben and Jules (Hathaway) is beautifully done, and it proves that even in the modern day, a close relationship doesn't have to be sexual in any way..., and it teaches people, especially modern people how to actually earn respect and organically grow a non-sexual relationship over a period of time, and proves that everything isn't instant gratification and you have to work at things, regardless of how old you are."
"A Truly Heartwarming Flick I really liked what this movie was trying to say with the tagline ""Experience Never Gets Old."""
"The society we live devalues the elderly, but this movie attempts to reinstate our respect and realize their value."
The experience and wisdom aspect of the film really does hold up.
"Coming to the movie, Nancy Meyer's The Intern is about Ben (Robert De Niro) who is tired of retirement and starts working as an senior intern at a new e-shopping company run by Jules (Anne Hathaway)."
The movie is about how he gets close to Jules and helps her both professionally and personally.
"The feel it creates is something I can totally get behind, feels like I just got a large cuddle from the movie itself."
"The movie doesn't promise too much, it doesn't expect to be this movie that will blow you away with hilarious laughter, serious scenes, or some other thing."
It is a subtle film trying to send the message that the elderly have a lot to offer and manages to be fun and entertaining.
It is a wholesome film that manages to keep a smile on your face throughout the movie.
There is just a kind of pleasantness in seeing De Niro's older character come into the life of Anne Hathaway as an accomplished person himself and help her out with some aspects of life.
The conversations between Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro are enough to make this film at least a one-time watch.
Their chemistry was just on point and it took the level of wholesomeness up a notch.
I really enjoyed watching this movie and did not watch much of De Niro's comedies prior to this so was surprised by how well he did in this movie.
"The film does feel like it is setting up some stuff at multiple points but it doesn't do anything too crazy, although the cheating plot thread was a little weird and felt like it could have been replaced with something little less deep."
"Overall, this is a feel-good movie which is definitely worth watching for how heartwarming it is."
"While being a fun movie it reminds you the value of elders, serving as a win-win for Nancy Meyers."
"good give it a 9, not because of the storyline but Anne and Robert, it seems no matter how brilliant you are, there's always a space to fill in elder's words."
"In personal life or professional area, you can fine useful giver nearby~ As for feminist part, i really don't get it, she works so hard to keep the business booming and under 100% of her control, however, there seems to be so many unorganized processes in the company, why its so wrong to hire someone helpful to give her a hand?"
"its not necessarily to replace her, instead, help her run the business smoothly~ But to be honest, though her husband did terrible things, if you have no time for your partner, whats the point to be together?"
Just want someone to buried with after life?
"""the intern"" The name is perfect for the film.and also who comes and goes in our lives..and also i think film has perfect ending is well....there is so much ce to my mind to write this review.but i think it is better to don't write anything apart from that."
The movie is a brilliant comedy!
I have been seeing the same type of comedies over and over and seriously the comedies are not that funny now-a-days.
The Intern is a totally different comedy movie.
I must say I'm very pleased with this movie.
The story line altogether was very unique and different.
"Upon that the legend Robert De Niro, what a fantastic acting by this man."
Anne Hathaway looked brilliant in this movie and she also made a great impact in this movie.
"Well, if you are a Comedy Genre fan, you can very much go for this movie."
This movie cannot get any much better.
"Best Comic Movie of the year 2015, THE INTERN."
Hats off to Robert De Niro and the entire The Intern crew!
"How One ""Actor"" Took Down an Entire Movie."
"Yes, that's right, Anders Holm was so incredibly bad that in the middle of an otherwise entertaining movie, that the only thing I could think about was how good the other actors were to offset his incompetency."
"He was so awful, so monotonic, so fake emotionally that I was drawn completely out of the story."
I wonder how many thousands of takes it took to just get him through the flotsam of slop of cuts he left in his wake?
Anders Holm.
Is.
That.
Bad.
"This was a bright, light script and De Niro absolutely made the movie."
"His character was endearing, and he played it seamlessly and expressively."
"While I like him in meatier scripts, he showed his versatility and makes acting look like a profession and art, not just an exercise in repeating memorized lines."
Too bad Anders Holm wasn't paying attention and sank a pretty nice ship.

A feel good film.
"When 70-year old Ben Whittaker; Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents, Limitless) finds out that being a pensioner isn't all it's cracked up to be, and comes across an ad for a start-up e-commerce fashion company looking for retired people as interns, he doesn't hesitate to apply."
"Appointed as the personal intern to the head of the company, Jules; Anne Hathaway (Les Mis√©rables, Alice in Wonderland), he has some challenges ahead, as she's not the easiest of people to deal with."
"Slowly they warm to each other, and Ben, being the perfect gentleman that he is, gets Jules to open up to him in ways that she wouldn't with other employees."
A sad love letter to late stage captialism I guess the title says it all.
"Essentially the movie is a ""passing of the torch"" kind of story that tries to convey that capitalism is a good thing for everyone, and that it always was and always will be with us."
"DeNiro's character represents ""the old guard,"" while Hathaway portrays the newer generation, and they have a very predictable mentor-teacher relationship."
"While telling a ton of endearing feel-good stories about working hard and getting your pay off, the film unknowingly establishes the reality of the failed meritocracy."
The story's hero is someone who comes out of retirement and starts working at an entry-level job.
"He does it not for any financial reason but because he is ""bored."""
"He is very laid back and calm, while (younger) people around him are nervous, suffer, and don't know what to do."
"Leaving aside the unrealism of it all (in most cases, people have a hard time retiring and then keeping living in NY), the film shows that actually, the only people who can feel comfortable in the cutthroat capitalist reality are people who don't have anything invested in it."
"While the cinematography is great, the film looks expensive and all; there is nothing of substance here, only a very predictable narrative that will anger anyone who is not 100% in the rat race."
"De Niro can do anything Starting a new job can be a difficult challenge, especially if you're already retired."
"Looking to get back into the game, 70-year-old widower Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) seizes the opportunity to become a senior intern at an online fashion site."
"Ben soon becomes popular with his younger co-workers, including Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), the boss and founder of the company."
"Whittaker's charm, wisdom and sense of humor help him develop a special bond and growing friendship with Jules."
The Intern is a feel-good comedy drama movie that is very enjoyable when you are tired and simply want something light to watch.
"Hathaway and De Niro are perfect for their roles and have a great chemistry that is so effective, it brings the whole movie together."
"Although De Niro's role is not nearly as difficult and astonishing as his very serious roles, like his role in The Godfather for example, he puts on a very good performance as the experienced 70-year-old intern."
"This character he portrays gives advice to his boss Jules Ostin, who has to juggle the work that comes with being CEO, and the compassion and support she has to provide as a mother and a wife."
My problem with this movie is that it is very predictable.
"The story is kind of plain, so the audience can predict most of the events that come about throughout the journey of both characters."
"Also, I felt like there was so much focus on Hathaway's character and her struggles towards the end, that De Niro's character was neglected."
"However, it must be said that the movie is quite funny and enjoyable."
The comedic scenes with the guys from work and Ostin's daughter were specifically very amusing.
"So, if you are looking for a movie that doesn't provoke any thoughts and emotions, that you can watch at the end of the day while tucked in your bed, and cozily drinking a cup of hot chocolate, this is the perfect movie for you."
Score:7.8/10.
A nice light-hearted film Robert De Niro does something for a change and stars in a warm fuzzy watch in The Intern.
"A man, who was once high in power, takes a lighter position for a company where he has to work under Anne Hathaway's wing."
He has seen the world of work and as the movie goes he tries to provide inside to Hathaway.
What starts out as a rocky relationship becomes a bit deeper and eventually settling.
"Seeing De Niro in a movie that's not nominated for an academy can come with its risks, I don't like Bad Grandpa, and Little Fockers is a disaster, but his charming sense and whit really works for this."
"And if it was anyone else in his role for this movie, it may not have been the same experience at least through my eyes."
I'll mention Anne Hathaway quickly who thrives in com-drams.
She's a good actor and she worked out very well for this role.
"There was one point in the movie I didn't like very much, mostly because I found it to be extremely unrealistic."
"It involves Hathaway and her husband, and it's not what he does to her but rather the conclusion they come to about the problem."
That sub-plot could've and should've had a different outcome.
It doesn't ruin the movie but I would've preferred a better outcome for said scenario.
De Niro and Hathaway will keep your attention.
Solid 7.
"Wholesome This is usually not my type of movie, but the unusual situation Robert De Niro plays in was entertaining and had me curious as to how things would play out."
"From the beginning of the movie, Ben Whittaker stood out like an odd duck among his new, much younger, ""hipper"" peers."
"Despite not being given much to do, Ben was determined to be productive and soon enough those he worked with were charmed by his wizened, gentle, and reliable character."
"Ben even ended up in an unlikely friendship with his younger, driven, workaholic boss, Jules."
It was touching to watch they're friendship slowly unfold to the point where they both became important people in each other's lives.
"This movie starts off with a 70-year-old, retired, widower hoping to fill the emptiness he feels and ends with him gaining another fulfilling purpose and friends that are like family."
"Go too movie , the intern Feel-Good Movie: ""The In""The Intern"" is a heartwarming feel-good movie, with well-portrayed characters like Fiona, Ben, and Jules."
"It's a wholesome film that leaves you with a warm feeling, making it my go-to movie for a delightful time."
"""The Intern"" is a delightful feel-good movie that captivates audiences with its heartwarming story and well-rounded characters."
"Fiona, Ben, and Jules shine on screen, each bringing a unique charm to the narrative."
"Robert De Niro's portrayal of the intern, Ben, is endearing and adds a touch of wisdom to the film."
The movie's wholesome nature is a refreshing break from the usual action-packed or intense dramas.
"It beautifully explores the themes of mentorship, friendship, and finding purpose in unexpected places."
"The interactions between the characters are genuine and touching, leaving a lasting impact on the audience."
"""The Intern"" is a perfect choice for a relaxing movie night."
Its engaging plot and genuine emotions make it a go-to film for those seeking a heartwarming experience.
The seamless blend of humor and tender moments keeps you entertained from start to finish.
"While some may find the plot predictable, the movie's execution and performances more than compensate for it."
Nancy Meyers' direction ensures a visually appealing and emotionally resonant journey.
"In conclusion, ""The Intern"" is a heartening and uplifting film that leaves you with a warm feeling long after the credits roll."
It's a movie that reminds us of the importance of human connections and the joy of embracing unexpected friendships.
A definite must-watch for anyone looking for a dose of positivity and comfort on screen.
"The Intern Review Looking to fill a hole in his life, 70-year-old retired widower Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) decides to challenge himself by starting a new job as a senior intern for an online fashion site."
"Over the course of working there, Ben becomes popular with his fellow, mostly younger, co-workers, including his boss and the founder of the company, Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway)."
"Ben's charm, wisdom, and sense of humor help him to quickly develop a special bond and growing friendship with Jules."
I would first like to say that I am not normally a fan of these types of films but I chose to see it being that I am a big Robert De Niro fan.
The vanilla story isn't anything too original here and you can probably predict how it's going to go but I didn't mind that too much.
It also isn't very plausible or realistic so you are forced to slightly suspend belief here.
"Despite all of that, the thing that kept me going were the performances of De Niro and Hathaway but more specifically De Niro."
He is just oozing with charm and class here and still has great comedic timing here.
He also had great chemistry with all of the other actors including Hathaway with whom he spends most of his scenes with.
They play very well off of each other which makes their character's relationship more believable and relatable.
Hathaway was great too but I feel like her role could have been played by someone else and would have been just as good.
"As I mentioned before, the film does have some comedic moments that I enjoyed for the most part mostly revolving around De Niro being an older person working with mostly younger people."
"Since he is older, he doesn't know much about young people things and they don't know much about older people things either."
Most of the comedy comes from his trying to understand all of these things and about how this predominantly younger world works.
"This is done through his interactions with his fellow co-workers including Jason (Adam Devine), Davis (Zack Pearlman), and Lewis (Jason Orley) and with Jules and her family including her husband Matt (Anders Holm) and her daughter Paige (JoJo Kushner)."
I thought these scenes were done well.
"I also thought the script was well done, more specifically the characters who I thought were very well written as they all seemed like real, relatable people."
"Going back to the story, what would have made this film better in my mind is if the story had a little more depth to it."
I think it tried to do many things but did not succeed at all of them.
Either it could have done less or explore the topics it tried to suggest more deeply.
"It tries to bring up topics such as generational gaps, women's equality, the life of a widower, etc but just glosses over them."
"Even with that, I still enjoyed it and gets my recommendation solely on the performances of De Niro and Hathaway."
Score: 7/10 keithlovesmovies.com
Heart-warming Real-life link: the movie deals with a number of real-life issues and does a great job to portray them as realistically as possible.
"It shows the issues that running a stat-up entails, a lot of work, crazy hours, little sleep, poor diet, and most importantly the endangering of personal relationships."
It also deals with the confusion of gender roles that couples face.
"According to society, the successful partner and the stay at home parent are predetermined by gender and when those genders gets switched it causes confusion and problems in the marriage even if both want that not to happen."
I loved how Jules marriage turned out not to be the perfect one that we first thought (even tho in the end it goes back to perfect).
Another thing that I loved is that the movie also dealt a bit with forgiveness and understanding (when Jules forgives and tries to understand her husband's affair).
It is good to be shown that not everything is done with a bad intention.
"And sometimes when the one doing wrong understands his or her mistake and asks for forgiveness, he or she actually means it and deserve to be forgiven (this however brought the couple back to perfection which moved the movie away from reality)."
It is this what makes you happy instead of thinking 'that I am too good to put up with this' or that 'I will never tolerate someone cheating on me'.
"I am not saying that it should be tolerated and accepted, I am just saying that in some cases it makes you happier to try and understand the other person and see if there is room for forgiveness."
At the end of the day we are all humans and we all make mistakes and most importantly what we all want is to be loved and cared about.
"Character analysis: Jules character was deep, lovable and quite real."
She kept the positive attitude despite the workload and stress and seemed to always be in a good mood because she loved what she did.
A good hearted person who had someone who loved her enough to push her into pursing her dreams because sometimes all it takes is a push.
Good hearted enough to be able to forgive and to try and understand why someone behaved as s/he did by at the same time trying to understand what she did wrong to contribute to that behaviour.
And all this despite being mad as every normal person would.
Matt-not deep enough but real.
The sad truth is that a lot of men feel emasculated with a more successful woman so they cheat to feel like a man again.
It is what society does.
It confuses people about the gender role.
"Despite this however, cheating must not be justified."
If you cheat once (no matter circumstances) it is hard to believe that you are as good and perfect as the movie wants us to believe that Matt is.
Ben-such a cute and lovable character.
"However, I found it to be a bit too shallow."
"The observant, the listener."
But still wise and probably the real reflection of an older's person behaviour in a workplace like the one in the movie.
Patty and Fiona- not to much from them but just enough to show ( for a thousand times in movies) that when a men is interested it will make it happen.
"If not, there is not much you can do I guess, just take the hint and walk away (with exceptions of course)."
Overall a heartwarming and interesting movie.
"One thing however, i though that Ben was gonna become the CEO so that Jules can still run the company without an outsider given her orders."
I was convinced about this the whole movie.
Imagine my surprise when non of that happened and the movie finished suddenly.
"So yeah, that could have been a plot options."
"So to sum up, a great movie and I would defiantly recommend it."
Wasn't the ending I wanted I really enjoyed this film.
I overlooked that Ben was perfect.
"I mean, he had no faults."
Do those people really exist?
Why have I never met any of them?
But I liked him so .
What bothered me was the ending where Jules ignored Ben's advice and gave her philandering husband another chance.
I realize she still loved him but I didn't want to see it.
The reason is because he was the least likable of all the characters in the movie.
He wasn't all that charming even with his kid when they were at play.
"He had no irony, wit, humor or charm."
I couldn't see why Jules married him except that she talked him up during their early marriage days.
So I wanted her to ditch him and go through the grief before finding someone more on her level.
"That's just me, perhaps."
I've never been married and the history there may color my perceptions.
Good film though.
"A simple pleasure It's such a rare joy to watch a film these days that doesn't rely on special effects, bad language, violence or crude humour."
"While I enjoy all of the above, in the correct context, and they certainly have their place - this film stands out as true gem to remind the current generation that they might just be missing out on something better (and simpler) by constantly 'dressing down' to be cool."
"To see the sloppy start-up culture (of which I'm somewhat a part) juxtaposed against De Niro's sharp suits and clear language, serves notice that being caring, human and honest is not forgotten among a lot of people and will always be honoured & respected."
"BOTH protagonists are hero characters - funny, caring, touching, warm and forgiving."
Serotonin and dopamine fire simultaneously watching this film from start to finish.
"In part, due to the fact these characters simply don't exist in real-life anymore... as much as they really should."
I would advise anyone with a warm to heart to watch this and simply give in to it.
"Accept it's Hollywood, accept it's Hollywood showing us a different side, a side it's more than capable of showing us."
"If we don't accept it, we only have the dark side left."
9.6/10
"Sweet, funny comedy I really enjoy this film."
"Ok, its not particularly deep and it doesn't require much thought to understand the plot."
"But what it does is entertain and charm, and isn't that what we watch films for mostly?"
To be entertained.
The leads play their roles well - Robert De Niro as a retired 70 year old widower who is finding retirement somewhat boring and lonely takes the opportunity to do an internship at Jules Ostin's (Anne Hathaway) online fashion company.
This film could have gone down the cliched route of De Niro's character Ben messing up because he isn't aware of the latest technologies or business practices of a start-up run by a millennial.
"Instead it shows that the older guy can impart his knowledge of business to this modern crowd, and at the same time find a sense of purpose, belonging, friendship and a new love along the way."
"There are one or two very silly, almost ""slapstick"" comedy setups which if overdone or too many in quantity would have spoiled the movie and made it something it isn't."
"Luckily we don't get a lot of cheap and all too obvious ""laughs"" here."
There is also a focus on a more serious side of a suddenly successful business - that it can have an impact on the personal relationships of the people running the business.
"This is covered very well, and quite sweetly."
"I've seen The Intern twice now, as its currently available on one of the subscription services I have at home."
Both times I've really enjoyed it.
"Its a very sweet, funny comedy that doesn't overly cliche either the older or younger characters."
Promising Movie with a Terrible Ending The movie started off well.
Robert DeNiro played a calm role he'd never played before (whereas his previous roles were all either mobster or angry father).
Robert DeNiro was incredibly charming and his chemistry with Anne Hathaway was perfect.
The next part of this review is where the spoilers come in.
"First problem was nothing was resolved: The intern is still living with DeNiro, we never find out if Jason and Becky end up together, they go nowhere with DeNiro's admirer, we don't find out where his relationship gets with the Masseuse, we don't know if Anne Hathaway made the right choice about her company in the end."
"The second, and much BIGGER problem: this movie is a life lesson that as long as a man cheats on you, it's OK as long as he apologizes and says he loves you."
I expected her to tell him no and end up falling with the new CEO or something.
"Hell, I would have even accepted her just sticking it out with DeNiro in the end."
"They go with the absolute worse possible ending, making the cheater forgiven, and having them ""live happily ever after.""..."
you know... until he cheats on her again and the family is torn apart.
"I went to bed with a smile on my face, I really liked this movie."
I simply loved this movie.
Anne Hathaway plays this modern business woman with a heart and soul and Robert deNiro is lovable from the first second you see him.
"He's been there, done that and just needs something to do."
So he applies for a senior internship at this new-fashioned fast rising web shop.
"His boss, a young woman with a dream, is trying to keep the control of everything that happened since her idea became a huge success and combine this with having a family."
"At first she doesn't want him around, but after a while she starts feeling comfortable and at ease when he slowly but surely starts to help her (without her even noticing it at first)."
"His devotion to help his boss is something I can relate to, and the hip and modern environment they work in I recognize as well."
"All is done very well, the characters (not all deeply layered, but that's not necessary for a light comedy) are truthful, the story is running with a nice pace and deNiro and Hathaway are a very good match."
Pretty Funny The Intern is defnitealy one of the funniest films I have seen in a while.
Its a very enjoyable with some particularly heartwarming moments from De Niro.
"My only problem would be that some of the actors, Jules husband are very weak."
"However, its still pretty enjoyable."
Well worth a watch.
Easy watching story of a driven and successful woman who needs a friend with no agenda for open and honest conversation.
Well scripted and well acted.
Quite boring Easy to watch however that's the problem.
I've been watching it for 2 weeks no and I keep putting it on and after 20 minutes I get distracted as is has no real depth to draw me in.
Ended up reminding me of 'the internship' which is 10x better in many aspects.
So I once again paused the intern to watch a full 2 hours of something else which confirmed to me that I just need to give up trying.
For everyone Today I am doing a movie review.
"Now, the movie review that I would do won't always be a recent movie, but it will be a movie all the same."
Today's movie is one from 2015 called The Intern.
Synopsis: 70-year-old widower Ben Whittaker has discovered that retirement isn't all it's cracked up to be.
"Starring: Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway Director: Nancy Meyers

Some are probably thinking why I would watch this movie, I was suggested this movie by my parents."
And I'm glad I watched this movie.
It is really good and has a proper meaning.
That meaning: Everyone needs help once in a while.
"Robert De Niro is masterful as the old, wise, seasoned worker."
"Anne Hathaway has the look of the overworked, modern mom to begin, so it wasn't that much of a stretch to see her in this movie."
The two of them played off each other so well that it only helped the movie.
"Like I said, the meaning of the movie is to get help if you need it."
Things just begin to get out of hand for the boss and it only takes one person to help her out and realize the error of her ways.
It's not that uncommon of a story.
A lot of people go through the same problem every day.
"I just wish this movie came out a few years ago, it may have helped me."
Nancy Meyers is a very good director.
She has made quite a few movies that I have liked.
This one is no different.
She knows how to make a sentimental movie with a great story.
I am strongly suggesting this movie to everyone.
It doesn't matter what type of movies you like; this movie is for you.
Rating: 8 out of 10
Not bad but a messed plot The story was enjoyable but the plot was all over the place.
Did not get what was the plot.
"Maybe it wasn't plot based film, but it was enjoyable."
"You know what you are going to get, right?"
I'm not surprised this movie has started with a relatively high IMDb score of over 7.
You know it's going to be a saccharin popcorn movie with a artificially sweet taste but do you know what?
That is fine with me.
"It perked me up, the pacing is right, as is the tone of the film."
The nay sayers may complain about product placement but it's 'that' sort of film to be expected and as long as it never distracts from the script or storyline (err...Rolex?
No Omega') it becomes white noise to me.
"De Niro is no longer a gangster in the world of Hollywood, and I have found some of his roles a bit painful of late, but he does really well here and the character is well suited to him as is the casting of Miss Hathaway."
Feel good?
Wanna feel a little better?
Give The Intern a chance and see where it takes you.
"Drama, Sci fi and Action seekers, go watch Goodfellas or Interstellar instead!"
"So sweet it will make your teeth hurt Jules Ostin runs a successful internet fashion start-up, but she has trouble combining business with her family live."
"Ben Whittaker, a 70 year old retired widower is looking for a way to give more meaning to his empty and unproductive live."
"When he spots an add for a senior citizen internship, applies to it and eventually gets the position, the two are teamed up."
Do not expect a lot of depth or insight from this comedy.
The movie lightly meanders from start to its unfulfilling end.
"The only thing that keeps this movie from totally caving in on itself is the talent and charm of mostly Hathaway and to some extent De Niro, the latter acts on autopilot for most of the movie."
lovely film from Hathaway and De Niro I really enjoyed this move.
There's a great chemistry between Hathaway and De Niro throughout the entire movie.
And both of them give wonderful performances thus the quality of the film lifted up by them.
"I do like the idea of ""senior internship program"" which is Ben got the job at the firm in this way."
"I, found this idea that is very creative."
"Also, i like the scenes which is Russo and De Niro in it."
This duo maintain and keep the sense of humor in film at a certain level.
"However, i don't like the ending because you know, it has kinda feminist side and female character leads the way which i like but she forgives her cheating husband at the end."
"Personally, it should've been ended differently."
"In general, even though i didn't like the ending, it's a lovely film and it's worth watching."
The Feel Good Comedy of the Year!
"Wonderful offering from Writer-Director Nancy Meyers that is INDEED ""The Feel Good Comedy of the Year!"""
"Robert DeNiro plays Ben a 70-year-old retiree, struggling to enjoy his days alone."
"When he spots an ad for a ""Senior Internship,"" working for a successful internet start-up, he relishes the opportunity."
"After getting the internship, he is assigned to the head of the company, Jules Ostin, played rather nicely by Anne Hathaway."
While Jules is not so quick to appreciate Ben - or the program in general - she eventually warms up to him and the idea.
"The two form a strong bond, and Jules comes to see Ben, not only as an asset, but a close and trustworthy friend."
Their bond is the crux of this movie and holds it together.
"There is an especially uncomfortable (at first) yet heartwarming scene, where Jules invites Ben to lay down in her bed late one night on a business trip."
DeNiro is spot-on as his Ben keeps one foot on the floor with a priceless expression on his face.
"Yet, by the end of the scene, the two of them are even closer."
"There is nothing Romantic about this scene, it is more about the close bonds of friendship."
I won't reveal anymore other than to say the abrupt ending was very satisfying to me.
"See it, you won't be disappointed!"
Very sweet and refreshing!
Lifts up your day.
Probably the sweetest and most mood lifting movie I've seen in a while.
Honestly cant stress how important the simplicity of this movie was.
Definitely worth the watch!
"Schmaltz, schmaltz, and more schmaltz If you want schmaltz and no surprises, this is the movie for you."
"Every plot twist, is barely a twist at all, and often predictable (oh look, Jules' apparently-perfect-at- being-a-house-husband husband Matt is having and affair, and Ben finds out completely by accident by just happening to turn down the road where Matt has just met up with his mistress)

But you know, many people like exactly that kind of movie, and this is a well made example of the genre."
"Robert De Niro proves (again) that he is a really good all round actor (not just a tough guy actor), and Anne Hathaway is also excellent, if a little 'gushy' (though, to be fair, that gushy-ness is more a reflection of her character than her acting skills)."
"So, it wasn't great, but it wasn't exactly awful either, and if this is the kind of movie that you like then you'll probably love it."
"Good Cast, Terrible Story At first glance this movie seems like a decent movie but it's really not...

Synopsis: A privilege white woman with mommy issues and too much opportunity starts a business off an unoriginal idea (cause online clothes shopping is nothing new), gets sad when she's too successful and starts an inappropriate friendship with an old intern who decided that a life time of working and having the chance to actually retire is too boring in a world where millions of people can only dream of retirement one day and decides to apply to work for said white woman for free."
"Said woman is riddled with guilt about her success because her spoiled hipster husband stays at home, contributes nothing but minimal parenting responsibility and then decides to cheat because his ego is so fragile that he can't stand his wife being a successful human being."
Over the course of a month (or maybe 2?)
nothing changes except that said woman stays with piece of child man child after a half ass apology.
Old guy who had a lifetime of happiness with his now deceased wife gets a girlfriend because being alone is bad.
Ends with Tai Chi session in a park in downtown New York (somehow?)
to symbolize how hard life is for white people and sometimes you just need to appropriate Chinese culture to make yourself feel better.
"Overall, this movie has no substance to it."
"But the cast is nice to look at, I guess."
"The Intern Lacks Diversity I saw ""The Intern"" today."
"It was a good story and it seems that I really enjoy Nancy Meyers stories as I also liked ""The Holiday"" and ""It's Complicated."""
I really appreciated watching the relationship develop between Jules and Ben which were wonderfully acted by Robert De Nero and Anne Hathaway.
The writing really addresses the juggling act that 21st century professional women attempt daily.
"I do have to say that I was most disappointed in the lack of diversity in the cast, even the extras."
"It was hard to locate one person of either African or Latino descent acting as a tech professional at Jules' company, yet when she visits the company warehouse to speak to the packers (a job that presumably does not required a college education) there is where we find our first extras of color."
I'm disappointed in the stereotyping and would have enjoyed the film more if the lack of diversity were not screaming out at me.
"Warner Brothers, please do what you can to educate Ms. Meyers and her casting directors because next time I just may keep my $10 rather than see a movie that assumes all professionals and those who live in trendy Brooklyn neighborhoods are all White."
A real surprise This came on TV and I watched it by accident.
I prefer his more serious movies.
Light entertainment but quite an enjoyable feel good movie!
"Good idea, good beginning, terrible conclusion As an older person (50yr old) who works in the tech industry, I was hopeful that this movie might show how those of us with more experience still have something to say and something to offer in today's tech world."
"And, the movie started as just that."
"If there was one flaw in the premise it was the older character was too perfect, too likable."
Even someone as intelligent as him would still have struggled more than was shown.
"However, I can overlook that somewhat."
"But, the movie had some very serious flaws...

First - The Hathaway character was not at all realistic."
"She was talked about as a hardass, but we never see that in her portrayal."
"She never yells, fires people, etc."
even when expressing disappointment at the test package she sent to herself she was smiling... not at all angry.
"Someone who (a) is portrayed as having a passion and high standards, (b) has been able to secure VC funding and (c) been able to grow a profitable business would be much more self confident and much more demanding than was shown."
"The character from the other Hathaway movie, ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" would be much closer to reality than this wimpy character."
"I am not saying nice people don't exist in that role, but people with that sort of drive and passion tend to be more decisive and more demanding than she is portrayed."
"My second large problem with the movie is the entire second half, where it shifts from being an interesting workplace story and becomes a relationship drama."
It would have been much more interesting if it had stayed in the workplace.
"The personal stuff could have played a part, but have that been part of a greater whole, not completely consume the movie."
In conclusion...
I was really disappointed with this movie.
"The watered down nature of the story, the cookie cutter characters, the unrealistic portrayal of the tech world and the people who inhabit it."
"I suspect that the original idea was written people with actual experience, but once Hollywood writers got hold of the script it became nothing but a bunch of clich√©s."
Touching and inspirational An unusual and really enjoyable movie.
"De Niro and Hathaway were superb, especially as De Niro was so different than he is most of his movies."
"The story line is great and makes one wonder why more retired people are NOT brought in as interns, or, as (paraphrased) one person said, ""who would you rather have as an intern...a seasoned retired executive or some kid who was recently playing beer pong in college?"""
The differences between the older and younger generations was subtle yet impactful.
"The references to the business world were quite accurate, vs many Hollywood moves wherein it is so clear that the writers are largely oblivious to the real business world."
Just a joy to watch.
"Charming film with great chemistry, but..."
"This is a feel good film with good chemistry n it does keep you engaged...but the truth is that almost everything they show in this film only happens in reel life, not real life...Anybody who's worked in a corporate world even for a short period of time knows it's never a charming 'inviting' experience...n that's what bugged me the most in this film...that it's utterly pretentious n imaginative...no CEO's behave like that, the younger colleagues don't give a rat's a** about older people n most of all, a strong independent multi million start up entrepreneur wholeheartedly forgives her cheating husband like he stole a pack of candy... just watch it as a film, have a good time n that's that !"
"Welcome change for Robert De Niro, u can see his most sensitive softer role to date."
A feel good movie with a weak ending...
The movie and story started well and in fact was enjoyable throughout.
One problem with so-called 'chick flicks' is they try too hard to end it like a fairy tale...which negates trying to build the characters at the beginning.
No story in real life ends happily ever after in all ways...trying to close off all loops in the nicest possible way leaves a sour taste for me because I feel cheated that I bought into the story for so long...
"I'd still recommend this movie though, as I found it enjoyable for the most part...just not the ending few minutes."
"It's a shame really because the first hour was great and I started to care about the characters...but by the time I walked out of the cinema, there was a mild annoyance of even bothering to care..."
"Overall, this is a solid 6.5"
Lifts up your spirits!
"When I sat down to watch this, I never expected it to be a feel-good movie."
Robert de Niro overwhelms us by outperforming his caliber.
I actually didn't have high hopes of the movie and was pleasantly surprised.
"Anne Hathaway emanates simplicity and elegance, playing her role as the overworked, ambitious, lost-the-fire-in-the-marriage wife with such finesse."
"I had been impressed with her in ""The Devil wears Prada"" and loved seeing her here, though it was the reversed role, with her playing the boss."
"With neither romance nor any personal agenda involved between the protagonists, the plot has a fresh feel."
"The generation gap in the corporate world puts emphasis on the fact that office-goers from the 80's feel out of place in the current techno-savvy biz world, interlinked with emails and social networks."
"But De Niro demonstrates his knowledge deficiency with calculated ease (which seemed a little fictitious, but we enjoy it)."
How Anne seemed solid on the outside but crumbling on the inside due to a failing marriage ironically on account of her achievements was commendable.
"De Niros's character is truly an embodiment of positivity and diligence; most people past the age of retirement feel they have retired in life too, this movie is an eye-opener that you are never too old to live."
An entertaining feel good movie that doesn't disappoint !
This movie is one of many feel good movies around.
The great thing about it is the built up of the movie and the fact that even when you know the outcome it still keeps you drawn towards the screen.
Robert de Niro once again proves his allround acting skills.
He mesmerizes you throughout the movie.
You feel for his character and the position he's in.
"Having grown up with a mum working with the elderly day in day out, she emphasizes the importance (sometimes to much in my opinion :) ) of not neglecting them and the experience and influence they still can bring to the table."
Seeing the movie unfold just makes you smile.
The chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Robert de Niro is great and the support cast is really nice in my opinion.
"The 'gang' gives the movie the comedic and light touch to it, although Anders Holm didn't really stand out or gave his character that much extra, he was just there."
All in all good entertainment.
cheers
Amazing Film That was the best film I saw after some time.
All the chaharacters did their job excellently.
"Pretty Good When I first saw the commercials for this movie, I thought it looked funny and a good movie."
"I have watched a lot of movies in the past , so I was a little hesitant to purchase this one."
Anna Hathaway & Robert De Niro were really good.
"I have loved them in other movie that they have done, so I kind of knew that it would be at least a 5 star movie."
So funny in some parts and it definitely made my parents and I laugh.
"The little girl was so cute, she did a great job."
This movie really makes you think about life today.
"It made me feel happy, sad, joy, & laughter."
"It was a long movie, but it didn't drag on like other movies did."
It kept with the story.
Handkerchief is neeed not only working in NewYork Ben is a man who is retiring the work and start to work at the fashion company as intern.
He is hired by Jule who is CEO at the company.
"Ben is a gentleman, his grooming is sophisticated and attitude for June is more than her expectation."
His advice that comes from his experience is so valuable for June and coworker.The feature of his advice is not only as working but also private.He attends to coworker as a person who has family and his attitude for the coworkers attracts them.All the man who see the film can learn the importance of carring the handkerchief.
After with this movie I suspected that this film is made to advertise handkerchief.
"Heart In a time where action movies and expensive popcorn flicks are dominating the box-office, it's good to see a well-balanced movie with a lot of heart."
"Some of you may think that this movie is a chick flick, maybe because of trailers or promotional materials, but believe me this is not the case."
"It's a funny feel good movie with good, not over the top, drama."
"I Highly recommend this to everyone who wants to watch a movie, especially together, and feel good in the end."
"The movie begins with a 70-year-old widower named Ben Whittaker, played by Oscar winner Robert Deniro, who is fed up with his retirement and longs for a goal/purpose in life."
When suddenly an opportunity arises allowing him to apply for an senior internship at an online fashion site.
"He is assigned to the company's boss Jules Ostin, played by the beautiful Anne Hathaway, and from that moment on we embark on a journey where we get to know the characters."
"The following will discuss the characters, music & cinematography, and the three-act-structure."
The characters within this movie are wonderful.
"The main characters Ben and Jules are portrait in a likable almost natural way, with moments that will evoke happiness and sadness."
You can feel the relation between the two characters being built from the first moment to the last scene.
"The supporting characters are similarly likable, and luckily not annoying (I truly hate movies with annoying supporting characters)."
"They are mostly funny characters used for the comedy relieve scenes, but the movie uses them in a subtle manner, which provides them a little bit of character development."
"In addition, remaining characters provide good dramatic support for the main characters in a not too clich√© way (sorry don't want to spoil too much)."
"The music used is upbeat and fits the accompanying scenes, however it isn't really anything special."
The cinematography is pretty good.
"The movie has a white gloomy feel to it, when it is showing the office or business side, and a warm and brighter look when showing family moments."
"Based on the three-act-structure, it has a funny energetic beginning, heartwarming middle, and a somewhat dramatic ending."
If there is one thing that is bothering me then it has to be the hammering of feminism.
Please don't misunderstand me I've nothing against it and more power to it.
But this movie tries to hammer it into us a little too much.
Maybe they should have removed some lines or changed certain dialogs.
It's a movie show us and don't repeatedly tell us.
"But hey, it's just a small quibble and it shouldn't bother most people (I hope)."
"O and I think they should've trimmed the movie a little maybe 10min to better the flow :P.

Al in all it's a good movie worth watching and I promise you you'll have a good time."
I give this movie a 8.
"Its the Story of Ben- ""The Intern"" I loved the film as Robert De Niro nailed it."
"Its the story of Ben, a 70-year old retired person who denies the concept of being retired, trying to explore the new world, joining as an intern in an E-Commerce Start Up."
A man who easily charms others by the way he talks with all that experience and maturity he has in him is a delight to watch.
He efficiently handles all the situations and is apt in his own old way.
"Jules on the other side, a classy, perfect,confident 21st Century girl who passionately runs the firm she started maintaining a work life balance."
She is stuck between the decisions she has to make about her work and her family.
There are few takeaways in the film.
To focus on the career and value the relations at the same time.
Be matured to handle every situation you face.
Explore life even after the time you are retired instead of waiting life to be withered.
"I loved the mix of the cultures, the generation gap between the two and Robert-Anne chemistry."
The movie ends with a positive note.
Robert Di Niro He had one of the most subtle characters ever in this movie.
I like this character immensely.
I don't know how he was received with this one.
I was blown away.
I wish I'm that cool when I'm that old.
DeNiro is always worth watching....
"It was OK - DeNiro was great, as ever, but Rene Russo ridiculously sidelined (cutting room floor?)"
"and woefully underused; the housebreak scene superfluous and unnecessary, and the ending weak."
"It was better than some of the films DeNiro undertakes these days, but could have done with a stronger plotline with a little more realistic grit and more faceted characters."
I must admit I wanted Ben to have more impact at the company - maybe be in an 'equally shared role' CEO with Jules?.
I feel helpless in front of movies as such.
Totally better than expected.
Heartfelt and beautiful.
"Watching movies like this makes you just unleash your emotional spectrum, and believe, it's a great thing to experience."
"If you are considering watching this, go for it immediately, you won't regret it."
"Nice heartwarming movie... Just watch this movie and don't be critical or analysing it cause it's not made for that, it's just for having a good time."
"I have watched all the ""good movies"" and mostly I watch them only but occasionally I like watching this normal drama comedy and this one was a good one."
But nowdays they don't make these kinds of movies it's all just serious drama or crime.
However good those movies might be but these comedy drama also have their place in movie business.
"Ofcourse de Niro and Anne Hatheway were delight to watch, their chemistry was too good."
"Great movie It's a great movie, that teaches us to respect older people and take into consideration their opinions
0 out of 3 found this helpful."
"Time well spent Until now I've not been a fan of Anne Hathaway, though I appreciate lots of people are, but in this movie I did come to like her quite a bit."
"Good acting, and looking 'normal' one might say."
Needless to say Robert De Niro was exemplary as usual.
And Jojo Kushner (Paige) - well doesn't she just make you melt ?
"lovely, brainy, great actress."
I have to say that the part of hubby played by Anders Holm was a bit weak.
But Becky played by Christina Scherer was super and reminded me of girls I habe met at the offices I have been to on more than one occasion.
All in all a very good movie that wife and self enjoyed immensely.
Would see this again no problem.
This film is definitely a winner Saw this film in a theater filled with senior citizens.
The laughter was literally nonstop.
"As I usually do, I listened to comments as I left the theater the only comments I heard were very positive."
"To sum them up, this was a thoroughly enjoyable movie from beginning to end."
Robert Deniro and Anne Hathaway were great.
He was both funny and likable.
"Anne Hathaway was great in her portrayal of a young, hip and highly successful internet business woman."
She operates he high tech business in an old Brooklyn factory as a hands on boss.
"She has her finger on the pulse of every aspect of the operation, Her employees are the usual assortment of computer geeks with some fashion conscious beautiful women thrown in for good measure."
Good movie I like Anne Hathaway.
"I watched the movie with my wife, as this was the only new English movie playing at the theatre nearby, we decided to check it out."
"I had heard a lot of negative reviews about the movie, I agree that Anne Hathaway could do better and that it is very stereotypical with the Devil wears Prada storyline."
A female lead with a dysfunctional life.
But the movie is a feel-good idealistic scenario.
"But I think it does what it should, moments of drama, fun and comedy and in the end leaves with a hope that life has its moments but things will be alright when one follows the heart."
"It does however point out the most obvious social message that is hasn't been touched, we teach young girls that they are strong and should follow their heart to lead a professional life, but miss the fact that the boys are left behind in the emotional development that is needed as a part of this change with women participating more at workplace."
We thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
I would definitely recommend for an evening to unwind.
Good Mood Beautiful beautiful movie.
It's just all the Good things.
A movie make your day.
This is happy and positive thoughts movie.
Nicely done by nancy meyers.
And show happy living and gathering the happy thoughts in your mind.
"It's filled with positivity and really new age Believe me, it's my first review on IMDb."
"Make no mistake, it's not the first film I'm watching or not even first Nancy Meyers film I'm watching but there ware something in this movie which compelled me to write."
Not only the plot is exciting but the way they have put it is simply beautiful and truly energizing.
Director has really presented some things which we yet in 21st century don't give a thought about or accept rather not that easily.
And one must watch the movie for that!
"Needless to say, the lead cast is fantastic and ease through their characters."
You will in seconds believe that they actually are who they are trying to portray.
"All in all, a very healthy, positive and fun filled experience it is, which makes you love your life again."
"And yes, truly new age!"
Wholesome.
"Ugh I loved this movie, definitely one of the movies that are at the top of my head It's so wholesome and just sweet and it's just ugh warms my heart."
Definitely recommend it to anyone who loves wholesome and sweet movies.
"also Anna Hathaway <3
0 out of 0 found this helpful."
One of the sweetest movies made lately Robert De Niro is the reason which made this movie so like-able.
"He plays an old gentleman who is so sweet that at some point, while watching the movie, you wish to be like him when you get old."
"Ben, a widower who is retired, see a flier while getting some groceries about a senior intern program at a start-up."
Unlike other seniors who showed up for the job he is the most full of life and physically fit.
He impress every body and he is Mr. Congeniality of the company.
"Ben is assigned to work with Jules, CEO, who is somewhat skeptical at first."
"Initially frozen out by her, Ben slowly wins over co-workers with his likability and gets into Jules's good graces."
This movie is all about Robert De Niro.
The way he played his character made me love this movie.
He have proved them wrong who say that De Niro's career has taken a nosedive.
The Intern is a family comedy which can be funny and dramatic as well.
Do yourself a favor and go watch it.
A good movie for all age groups to see Very amusing for both Anne Hathaway and Robert DiNero.
Really think this will be a winner for both.
Ann Hathaway seems to be trying her wings at different poetic scenes and she is doing very well showing that she can play different roles.
Ms. Hathaway has come along way in her field and she has done well in everything that I have seen so far that she has starred in.
"Robert DiNero, he is a star by far."
What can you say.
There is no one that can top that man.
I love the work that he does.
"He can be funny, he can be serious, he is fabulous!"
Mr. DiNero has worked with many women and they all seem to do much better work with him.
I don't know if he is teaching them as they are doing their roles during the filming or if he just has that magic touch that brings it out when you see the film in its finished process.
Priceless as they say.
"""The Intern"" is a satisfying parental/mentor/business/family drama."
The intern presents an interesting and often not-acknowledged view on retirement.
"For a working population, retirement presents an opportunity to rest, freedom for work shackles and pressure coupled with the delicious thought of having to travel to places seen."
"And Ben having seen all, done all-becomes bored."
Robert de Niro still with his trademark facial expressions and mannerisms brings the character to life.
"More so, the film's plot buttresses and enforces that idea: retirement isn't what it seems to be."
"And for Ben's case, it is even more understandable given that his wife is dead-making room for lone times."
"Those scenes in which he goes out, without any destination in particular or have coffee in cafeterias in the hopes of having a normal conversation goes without saying that the films doesn't just presents thoughts, perspectives or opinions."
It supports it with actions.
"How do the over 60s age group cope with the 21St century tech suaveness: Google, face book, twitter and a host of others."
"After Ben joins the senior intern ship programme, it is evident, very, how he struggles with the youth vibe and culture in this new company- very different work practices from his own generation."
"Though he conquers-not technically, but by being everyone's friends-employing that seasoned old man's knowledge."
"Nevertheless, it is not properly fleshed-out."
"--------Genre-wise, it is hard to place ""The Internship"" a particular group."
But a simplistic way of looking at it would be by calling it a parenting/mentor film.
Three-quarters of the film features Robert de Niro's character Ben serving as a guidance counselor to Anne Hathaway's-in few cases saviour.
Robert fits up to that billing.
His character is mature to a fault.
"In scenes where you expect him to unknowingly make a mess of things, he doesn't."
Another actor who fits this role is Morgan Freeman.
"It vexes me that that Rene Russo was short changed for this role, though she has that romantic chemistry with Robert."
I feel she is too big of a star to take the role of a masseuse with a few glorified cameos.
Anne Hathaway stands out as Jules Ostin in her character's multidimensional abilities: wife/mother/businesswoman/CEO.
"However, the character strengths are downplayed while making her alienable at first sight-in a bid to make her a likable candidate for moral lessons, advice and saving."
It is worth noting that the scenes between her and Robert feel relaxed and awkward at the same time.
"Finally, the good will of ""The Intern"" is nearly spoiled by that rushed third act finishing and glaringly playing to the audience's expectation and fantasy, but overall ""The Intern"" is a satisfying parental/mentor/business/family drama."
It's feels WoW After watching this.
You can imagine how a great production make a simple story to gorgeous one.
Ooooh.... That's great.
Everything is perfect.
Good until end Robert and Anne killed it with their performances obviously.
But i got really mad when she got back together with him at the end.
SO STUPID MAN.
"This promotes staying with a cheater, and the mindset that everything can go back to normal in the worst situations."
I was loving this movie until she got back with him I was so mad.
"Anyways if you're looking for a good movie to just pass time (which I was doing) it is a great movie, until the end of course."
"Overall it is a nice movie Anne and De Niro's chemistry was off the charts I also love the little girl, and the group of interns, very nice comradery."
between them.
I think the replay value of this movie is medium and I will be will looking forward to seeing it again one day.
"I actually really loved this movie Watched this with no intentions of what it was about, not even seeing a trailer."
"Great, feel good movie without being over the top."
Deniro pulls of a great role as a fatherly figure who has experience and eventually pulls Anne thru most of her turmoils.
Im actually really surprised to see so many haters.
"I myself can be very critical, but this movie delivered for what it was set out to be."
Deniro shows that he can be versatile and is a great actor.
Anne is great also she has done roles like this before.
I really liked the start up business story and bringing someone like deniro as quirky as it seems has some real good messages.
I guess some critics are just very superficial or had certain expectations coming into it before they watched it.
Beautiful movie Perfect in every way.
"Sweet, innocent, funny, great acting, really loved it."
I recommend it for everybody who cares for a good laugh and some heart opening moments.
"Enjoyably Witty Today we went to see ""The Intern"" starring Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway."
"Surprisingly, I rather enjoyed it."
The chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway is really the star here and it is adeptly handled by writer/director Nancy Meyers.
"The ensemble cast provides a well-balanced dose of giggles, tears and panache."
It's good to see De Niro not going too much over the top for laughs as he has been prone to do in recent years.
Hathaway is believable in her role and you feel for her as she deals with the ups and downs of balancing her life as a successful business person and being a wife.
"As with so many films today, The Intern is ripe with references and examples that clearly illustrate the differences between the way things were back in the day and the whole social media-driven mentality of modern day standards of acceptance."
Kudos to Anders Holm and JoJo Kushner in their respective roles as the husband and young daughter and for pulling off what almost comes across as throw away parts until too far into the film.
"All of this being said and without divulging spoilers, for this reviewer as with so many of these recent ""successful white collar yuppie bromantic"" type of comedy films (for lack of a better label), the ending was weak and all too predictable."
"Still, I give it 7 out 10 stars for effort."
"Old fashioned man After I finished watching this movie, I immediately want to make friends with Ben."
Robert De Niro is the perfect for the role of him.
Ben is gentle and intelligent.
"He is old-fashioned but become loved by every co-workers Jules, Anne Hathaway, is a entrepreneur and a mother."
I laughed at her cycling in the office.
She tries to be perfect both in the office and the house.
"But she gives more weight to the job, so her husband does housework."
Still working women are not so popular.
It is pathetic that Jules is looked coldly by other mothers.
"Her effort for balancing work, childcare and marital relations are very tough."
"She never whines about her job and home, but she only does in front of Ben."
He just listens to her without saying nothing.
Their relationship is charming.
It makes me notice that you can be friends with anybody without regard to age or sex.
Expectation vs reality I came here expecting a masterpiece and am going back after seeing a showpiece.
"The story starts off with a lot of promise and has a lot of leads from which the story could have taken off in a great fashion, but till the last minute, there seems no such effort has been taken."
On what basis did Anne Hathway make the decision that Ben's (De Niro) role as an intern seems to be working after getting him transferred is beyond me.
"To be honest, If anyone who's handled an entire team for over 40 years (based on which he was chosen as an intern), is not observant(to get him transferred), then the person who's making the decisions(Anne Hathway) is taking baby steps in handling business and has a lot to learn."
I expected to hate this...
"I expected to hate this, but De Niro is my favourite actor so I figured I'd give it a go."
I can't stand schmaltz.
"Can't stand jazz, soppy stories with light comedy moments, anything about New York, anything involving trendy hipsters or precocious but cute kids... and I've always thought Anne Hathaway was overrated."
"Yet here I am, admitting I thoroughly enjoyed this film."
Ms Hathaway was wonderfully convincing in the role.
"The story was wholesome (albeit with some unnecessary swearing in one instance, which soured it slightly), poignant and entertaining."
And believable.
"The story reflects the reality of our age, and the roles we're assigned by society."
"It deals really well with the image of women as powerful figures, and with age-related perceptions."
"The biggest let-down (only in my opinion, obviously) was from Mr De Niro."
"His acting in The Mission remains one of the best performances I have watched to date, but I think maybe he should choose his comedy roles more carefully."
One 70 year old man visits a young lady who is a president of Internet shopping company to work.
His honest and sincere behavior changes the company gradually.
I like this movie.
This story is suits modern world.
"Japan is aging society, so many people may sympathize with this story and this story may reflect modern social problem."
I can receive the message that it is not too late to begin something even if you are 70 years old.
I can have courage when I finish watching this movie.
The character of one 70 year old man and a young lady who is a president of Internet shopping company is really good.
The elderly man plays an important rule to the lady overcome difficulties.
The performance of the actor and actress is also good.
Its ok and heartwarming.
Love me some Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway.
A comedy/drama with those two that touch on 2 different generational perspectives is interesting to me.
However the movie ended abruptly for me.
Their drama felt intriguing though fleeting and sometimes forced/cringe (like the masseuse).
It also feels like a flawless character Ben walks into Jules life and somewhat fixes everything about her and her situations.
"I was hoping for a deeper dive and clash between the two different generations (also no pushback when Jules gets drunk and dunks on the boys)

Either all its inoffensive and a fine family movie for all."
"Roberts character ""Ben"" inspired me to always carry a hanker-chief which is a weird take away for me."
Loved until the last 5 minutes!!!!!
Absolutely loved most all of this except for the ending!!!!
Really she's that big of a feminist and she goes back to her cheating husband???
Sorry I'm angry

Feel Good Movie Love.
Love.
Boy!
De Nero is AMAZING.
Never looked cuter i guess.
Anne Hethay is sweet as sugar.
Such a feel good one.
Why don't they make more movies like this.
"Oldies are goldies A lazy Saturday night with nothing to do, with a box of popcorn and cappuccino, ideal way to watch the movie 'The Intern'."
"Never liked Anne Hathaway, never will like her probably."
She and her fashion diva type role really sucks.
And I can never dislike Robert De Niro.
So basically this movie is about my most liked actor and most disliked actress.
"To be honest the day was saved by De Niro and Rene Russo, who by the still looks stunning even in her 60's."
They kept the movie going till the end and actually created some genuine laughs.
The movie is the same old concept of old people catching up with new generation including the idea of stay at home husband to opening an account in Facebook.
"While the younger generation is learning about gentleman-ship and Chivalry.Nothing new to offer really

So if you are a fan of feel-good flicks, this might be your cup of tea."
Enjoyable movie Recently saw this for the first time.
Directed by Nancy Meyer (who also directed The Holiday (2006) which I have seen many times).
This is a very good film with nice story about a 70 year old intern & brings humor to the role.
Enjoyable Movie Quite surprised with De Niro's performance next to Hathaway.
I found this movie to be entertaining even though I found the plot to be somewhat unbelievable.
"Do not miss this one... As someone in your sixites, your first instinct to a 30 something giving an advice is, 'Really, you've the audacity?'"
"So when I watched Robert De Niro as Ben Whittaker trying to make himself useful as an intern at About The Fit, a startup sensation, an ecommerce company founded by Jules (Anne Hathway), by helping the delivery lady, by coming in at 7am to clear a table that was unofficially the dustbin of the office and to take Jules' blazer to laundry when she stains it, I knew this was a very interesting character in the making."
"But, all Ben was doing was showing you the dignity of labour and how you could totally connect to people two generations after you by just being calm and helpful."
The Intern is not a preachy movie and it is not about how a 70 year old chivalrous gentleman comes and fixes the problems in the life of Jules.
"In fact, he does nothing of that sort and the movie, pretty much ends where it begins, with Jules continuing to be the same driven, passionate person who would go to the warehouse and tell her workers how to pack deliveries when clothes were ordered."
The movie is not about one person saving the day for another person.
"It is about how small things in our everyday life could be fixed with good attitude and good humour and Ben personifies the guy who doesn't take offense at anything, loves his work (which is why he returns as an intern to a company now running in a remodelled version of his old workplace - a nice touch to the story)."
Ben is a great guy who tries to look like the guy next door and it helps that he teaches mannerisms like carrying a handkerchief on you so you could offer it when some lady is crying.
"From start to finish, the movie shows you how the big problems are rarely about the big problems."
"There is a lesson here for all of us, Look at your elders and learn from them as the movie tagline says ""Experience never gets old""

Well the movie does have its own flaws but who am I not a critic, just a fan."
"Give the movie a chance, will ya?"
A gem This is a very surprising film.
"I thought I was hound to be nothing but as always, as always, nothing becomes something when you put it in Robert De Niro's hand."
Is there anything this man can't do?
"Really, from jimmy conway to a retired widower restarting life as an intern."
What a gem.
"And never do you feel sorry for him, h√° doesn't act like a victim, there's no putty party, he takes it as it comes and does the best out of every situation."
A bit sappy but wouldn't we all be better people if we could do the same?
"The supporting cast is great, I consider Anne Hathaway supporting in this, because it is Mr. De Niro's delightful, intelligent and never ""hamming it up"" performance that makes this nothing into something great."
Keep an eye on him.
He never over plays it.
What a gentleman.
On of the best feel good movies for some time.
"Very rarely do I want a film to be a good hour or two longer, I could spend a whole season and more with Ben and Jules."
"On the surface it looks like this is going to be an odd romcom vehicle for Hathaway and Dr Niro, but don't let that notion put you off, mainly because it isn't really a romcom, yes there are romances in the film, and this really isn't a spoiler, but ultimately it's a film about a man and woman becoming friends, which is kind of a rare thing in a big budget Hollywood film."
"Like many others, I find something kind of annoying about Anne Hathaway, but this was by far my favorite performance from her, I actually started to really like her in this, she was cast perfectly, as was De Niro, the film is a nice reminder of just how strong a character actor he can be and why he's regarded as the best, and Myers has probably created literally the most like-able character ever with Ben, if you don't fall in love with him, then you're a straight up monster."
"For me The Intern is a near perfect film, I rarely give 10/10 to anything."
"Yes it may not be groundbreaking, but in some ways the film is, it eschews the typical expectations from a big budget film like this, and I think only someone like Myers is in a position to do a film like this."
"At the end of the day, it's literally what a feel good film is, you like all the characters, there isn't a typical antagonist, at least not in human form."
"The only real criticism I can give is the casting of Anders Holm, who is a fine dramatic and comedic actor, that anyone who watches Workaholics will adore, but something just didn't feel right with his casting here, maybe it's just that I don't buy him and Anne Hathaway together, despite the fact he kind of looks like her real life husband."
"It's a slight mis-step to me, and maybe he wasn't the first choice, maybe he got the role after Adam Devine got cast, or vice versa."
"But it's a very small criticism, because he does the role well, and it hardly detracts from the film as a whole."
"Get a bottle of wine, and enjoy!"
Overrated!
It is completely overrated.
There is nothing to watch this movie.
"Tries to do too much and fails A film that is trying to tell too many stories simultaneously, with the result that none is properly explored, or worse, really makes us care about that much."
This is a movie about a retired widower coming back to work as an intern in a hip fashion house and the comedy that arises from his old-school low-tech been-there approach to life and the web-wise younger generation colleagues who think they know it all but really have a lot to learn.
"And, it's a movie about a woman who's built up from scratch a really successful company but is struggling to create the right balance between work and family, her one-time high-flyer house- husband is playing around, her business funders are concerned about the company's rapid pace of growth, and she's considering big conflict choices between what's best for the business and what's best for the family."
"It's a film about trust, and the need we all have for someone to whom we can open our hearts, on whom we can lean and depend with total confidence that they will never let us down."
And it's a film about love and loss and forgiveness and loving again.
"Yes, it's all of these things and more, and yet not one of them really takes centre stage, the characters never grow credible in any of these scenarios and plot lines; the whole thing is a jumble."
And it's riddled with absurdities and clich√©s that remove any hope of believability or realism.
"Surprise surprise, this hip company turns out to occupy part of the exact same office building that Robert De Niro once used to work in."
"Coincidence, eh?"
"The ""reward"" massage that first introduces the Rene Russo character to Robert De Niro is, depending on your point of view, either offensive (male teenage fantasies aside, just imagine if the genders were reversed) or totally implausible."
The cheating husband is both a casting bloomer and an almost wholly unbelievable character all the way through.
The heart-to-heart chat in the hotel room after the fire - so clunky it really struggles.
"And the ""funders want to bring in a CEO"" plot device!"
"I mean, is there anyone who knows a thing about business who wasn't shouting ""a COO, not a CEO, a COO is what you need"" at the screen?"
"Could have been great, but really trying to do far too much."
And failing.
Feel Good Factor !
After a long time I saw a movie which is so positive and encourages you to try and materialize your dreams.
You have to always keep that hunger for learning alive in you no matter whatever stage you have reached in your life.
During the whole movie I felt so happy and was grinning all the time.
Robert De Niro stole the show for me.
He looks so genuine and still smart at this age wearing the suits for work which has a start up culture (This makes me realize that Suits always enhance your personality and add a class to your personality).
Story Telling and Direction is good and it never bores for a minute.
I would recommend to try this movie as it adds little bit of positive attitude in your life no matter whoever you are.
Sweet movie with a crucial fault.
"Since most of the reviews I've seen takes care of the plot, I think I'll have a stand alone opinion in what is wrong in this otherwise super cute movie."
When you use an actor like Anne Hathaway.
"I mean, maybe one of the most beautiful actresses there is."
"Alright we know we shouldn't judge by how people look, I am going to do it anyway."
"Because there is a glaring difference between Jules and her husband, as much as it isn't believable."
"Alright, people can have their charm, but to have that charm you need to sell it."
"He didn't sell it at all, I never found him charming or warm, or had any sort of relationship with her."
"He also cheated on her, which is in fact for many men and women out there is not forgivable."
Yet she forgave him for sleeping with some parent in their kid's school within 90 seconds of his pathetic excuse of an apology.
"We as viewers don't know this man, all we know he isn't good looking, he cheats, lies, go out of his way to have an affair."
How am I as a viewer accept his apology and for her to accept it so easily?
We can't!
"We don't know this man, what makes him special?"
It is a base for a good story.
Sadly the writers got too lazy at the end.
"5/10 for ruining something that could be forgiven, if written well."
"Charming I didn't have high expectations for this film, but I was pretty surprised at how much I enjoyed it."
"Even though it deals with a lot of modern-day ideologies and so on, it wasn't painful or cringy, in my opinion."
"Good on first viewing, but is somewhat predictable The Intern is one of director Nancy Myers' better works in the genre, although not the best."
"It has its moments of bitter heartbreak, internal conflict, and fairy tale ending, but literally none of these evolve around the title character, but the intern's young female boss, played by Anne Hathaway."
"If you like her, or appreciate her performance, then you'll like enjoy this film, and vice versa."
"These emotions ultimately fall just short of inspiring, which is a shame."
"With more character development and a less predictable plot, perhaps it could have been even better."
(Although its reception and box office numbers are still very respectable as things stand).
"I imagine Robert De Niro's character was intentionally designed to stick as close to the wise old man/sweet father-figure stereotype as possible, and in De Niro's case with a perma-smile, and it works in this film most of the time."
"However, this is also my biggest disappointment with The Intern."
De Niro's character is inherently limited for the same reason that it works in the way it does.
There is no character arc whatsoever for him in this film.
"Rene Russo aka his newfound love technically doesn't count, since this little romance subplot was as artificially inserted as they come, and could be seen coming by anyone familiar with the genre from miles away."
"De Niro started the movie bored with retirement (this boredom not represented in any meaningful way), and he sees an opportunity to work in a new internet company which happens to be located in the same building where he spent his entire working career (little secret revealed halfway through with no consequence)."
"De Niro's character finishes the movie with a girlfriend (Russo), a new close friend/boss (Hathaway), but how is he a different man than when he started?"
How is he changed?
What has he gone through?
Next to none.
"One moment provides a glimmer of hope as De Niro and Hathaway engage in a heartfelt exchange in the hotel room on Hathaway's marital situation, a conversation which makes it plain obvious to the audience that we are at least halfway through Act III now, with one big resolution coming up soon to end the story."
"Disappointingly, Hathaway's crisis practically solves itself in no time (the cheating Hubby confesses his wrongdoing and begs for a second chance, which Hathaway happily accepts, thus giving the happy ending the filmmakers want to give us in a very rushed manner), De Niro is then back to showing the young-lings the wisdoms of life, teaching tai-chi to his boss who has just gone through a private nirvana and was born again."
De Niro is the same man in everyway throughout the film.
"My other complaint is that the plot twists are all too predictable, or perhaps it's just that I've seen too many similar films and all the usual premises have been done to death in them."
The big reveal at the end of Act 1?
Turns out the senior intern has a history with the building.
"The intern is unwanted by the boss, but gradually transforms her opinion of him, even becomes a part of her personal life?"
This can't be the first film where you've seen a similar plot.
The central focus of Act 2?
Turns out the boss's home life is far from perfect.
How so?
"A cheating husband, of course."
Perhaps I'm complaining too much.
"Hathaway's performance is stellar, and overall it has been a better than average viewing experience, but I can't see myself wanting to visit this again in future."
6/10 (fresh)
Will warm your heart and bring a tear to your eye.
"Yes, yes, yes, it's not a groundbreaking plot but that doesn't matter - it's wonderfully heartwarming!!"
"This film reminds you of your grandparents, it reminds you older and younger generations can learn from each other."
"It reminds you, that we all need someone to catch us when we fall, and it does that while warming your heart then bringing a tear to your eye."
Boring This movie it is just so boring.
Nothing exiting happens!
All the characters are not interesting.
"It's not a disaster or horrible, it's just not interesting."

"A likable movie if you just don't expect much This is a very likable, cute and ""feel good"" kind of movie."
"It's entertaining, just don't expect much."
"It somehow feels like it could have been better, maybe if the script were a little deeper."
"Also, the character of Matt (Anne Hathaway's husband)- talk about miscast."
"He's such a dweeb, you can't even imagine that Anne Hathaway's character would ever be attracted to him to begin with, and yet the irony is that..HE is the one having affair."
"Anyway, I usually find Anne Hathaway fairly annoying, but I liked her in this, and I loved Robert DeNiro's character, which is basically how every character in this movie feels as well."
Well maybe except for Linda Lavin's character lol....
Movie which is more than I expected.
"This is a movie encircling about a retired 70 year old widower,Ben played by Robert De Niro."
"He plays the role of a person who has served many years and after his retirement from previous job ,he is bored to death and seeks to work for free as an Intern for a booming e commerce company."
Anne Hathaway and De Niro chemistry wins the heart.
It is a feel good mainstream movie featuring two big time movie stars .All the characters are well conceptualized and sketched.This movie also proves that age is not just but a number.
More fantastic than Harry Potter I have grown up with a toxic father so Ben is a more fantastic character for me than Harry Potter.
"Really, have you ever seen such a man over 65 around you?"
"Maybe in America, I don't know."
"Also, what actually happens in this movie?"
What is the story?
"An incredibly calm, good, modern, kind, good looking, healthy old man who knows everything makes an online shopping company better?"
Where is the conflict?
Let me tell you this I have worked in big corporates and currently working in a start up.
People would eat Ben alive.
"Overall, it was an unrealistic feel good movie for me."
It depend on your mind.
"As you get older, your sense of exercise becomes dull, and the relationship between people is diminished."
"Young people can not understand at all, and the situation that only older people feel is coming at a certain moment."
"Looking back, life really went as fast as an arrow."
"This film is less realistic, but it seems to have led people to look at retired people from a positive perspective."
"Most of the past experiences are no longer needed because of advanced technology, but there may be times when you need a lot of experience and mindfulness at difficult moments."
"If you have an elderly senior when a difficult situation is happening, will not it be a bad thing?"
I feel my heart warming throughout the movie.
PS: Thanks for reading.
Please understand that my English is not good.
^^
"Nice enough *** Thematic spoilers***

Yes, Robert De Niro is terrific."
"And that is expected, too."
Nothing new there.
Also Anne Hathaway is a wonderful actress.
Together they are capable of tremendous work.
But 'The Intern' aims for much less.
"It isn't a bad movie, it is very nice and warm in fact."
"It took me a while to understand the bar it set itself and once I reconciled my expectations with that bar, I was happy with it."
"I loved the contrivances and found the movie to be thoroughly enjoyable, too."
But I'm still cognisant of the possibilities.
"For one, I really really wish Ben Whittaker wasn't a flawless star."
He is a seventy year old white man with years of experience running a company.
To write the character to be one without any biases (not the objectionable ones at least) or foibles is taking a very simple route.
"Not just Ben, every one in the movie is sweet, nice, and harmless to the point of being cloying."
"Like I said, The Intern doesn't aim too high but I wished there was a little more drama in the proceedings."
"I wish at least one of the leads would make mistakes, or a situation transpires where tough decisions need to be taken but nothing of that sort occurs."
"But even without these elements, it is a great watch for the performances, and the humour, and the smooth direction."
And I really liked a point or two that the movie made.
"Being a 25 year old male, I didn't exactly understand the feminist standpoint initially but it made sense to me later and I appreciated the fact that the movie made me think about it."
I can't say much more without giving away the plot but you can try the movie yourself and appreciate what I'm talking about.
"Great duo Not my style of movie but watching it for the third time right now... De Niro is great and Hathaway is better, other interns are futile and a little over the top."
"Had they concentrated all in the duo and interactions with others,this would be a 9."
"The Intern Review A friend of mine who is also a movie lover described this movie in a few simples words "" Why did Robert De Niro do this movie?"
"Normally older actor accept projects they really like""

A Wonderfully Written and Acted Feel-Good Movie I really enjoyed this movie.
The characters were believable real-life people while the theme was light and heartwarming.
"If you work in the tech industry like I do, you'll appreciate the pros and cons of owning your own tech business and the employee's that you'll need to hire."
Mr. DeNiro was exceptional with his acting skills in this flick.
"He was sincere, steady, and strong in this role as an Intern providing life's experience to a young start-up mom."
"Ms. Hathaway was also exceptional in this role as I watched her going through the emotional trauma of owning your own business and keeping one's relationship, with husband and daughter, in tact."
There were a couple moments where I had a tear in my eye as I could relate to both as an older adult.
The funny parts were not overdone and brought a smile to my face.
I would recommend this movie for all ages.
It's the best movie I've seen this year (2016).
"Mildly entertaining, but zero on the believability index I'm the weird movie watcher."
"I can watch a movie with a premise that is not totally believable, but certain things can spoil the fantasy we're supposed to believe instantly."
"For me, this happened almost instantly where we're taken to this bustling Brooklyn e-commerce business with hundreds of employees at their desk answering calls and looking at email."
"All on banks and banks of spanking new, perfectly aligned Macs."
Come on!
Is there a company anywhere on planet earth of this size that would be using Macs like this?
"Every desktop, every laptop has the Apple logo."
"When Apple got this opportunity, they must have seriously soiled themselves at the opportunity to have the big screen filled with their products."
"Have you EVER heard the term ""Let's Netflix a movie tonight""?"
Little things like this really take me out of the fantasy of a movie.
"Otherwise, the movie is kind of cute."
"The premise of having to break into the mom's house made me think ""Oh... one of those stupid, would never happen in a million years type movies.""."
"You've got a guy like Ben that is supposed to be all proper, dresses well, speaks well, has an immaculate house, and has the proper answer for everything is all of the sudden breaking into mom's house with a bunch of unlikable zit- faced kids."
"For a 2 hour plus movie, that scene should definitely have been removed."
"Lastly, casting, is there anyone that believes a woman like Jules would have a husband like Matt?"
Anyone?
Neat and proper Jules married to a schmo like him?
Not believable.
"All in all, I'd say I endured this movie."
"I hated a few things, but DeNiro and Hathaway salvaged an otherwise poorly executed story."
Nice and cute Really nice movie.
"It is a good for just relaxing at home, no unwanted drama or anything."
"We watched it with my better half, and enjoyed it."
"There is a ""moral of the story"" , but it is really well put."
Also the casting is great.
Nice drama ever Very nice story with many sweet moments.
De Niro and Anne Hathaway made this movie more interesting with their awesome chemistry Love this!
Excellent Movie!!
I had watched the trailer of the movie few years back but happen to watch it today.
Lovely piece of work the plot is brilliant and execution is marvellous.
Must watch!!!!
I didn't care for this film -- -- not due to its technical strengths.
The story in three acts is well structured and filmed much like the romantic comedies of 1990-99.
"What I DIDN'T like about is was, a smart, together business woman -- forming and leading her own successful corporation in New York City -- still relies on the intelligence and wisdom of the elder male."
A bit too paternal for my tastes in that way.
"The relationship between Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro is tender, sweet -- there is good chemistry there."
It would have been interesting and perhaps more topical to EXCHANGE these roles -- watch the impact of the rise of modern feminism depicted in the characters.
Contrived plot.
Dissapointing.
Great premise let down by a poor plot and dialogue.
"Well Acted Movie Bogged Down by Clich√©s Overall, I quite enjoyed the movie."
"It's a cute movie about growing old, marriage, and balancing work life with family."
"It was well acted by DeNiro and Hathaway, and the remaining cast also played their roles well."
"You laugh, you cry, etc."
This movie's cast and writing team alone easily could have earned this a 9/10.
"But unfortunately while the premise is interesting and the execution is good, by the third act it falls into quite a few clich√©s and sappy resolutions."
"If you're not familiar with the genres of the retirement story or the work life balance movie, you'll probably give it an 8 or 9 out of 10."
"If you are familiar though, the third act will have you rolling your eyes constantly."
"In particular, there is a climactic scene in which a character who did something very bad gives an apologetic speech to Hathaway."
"The film earlier built up that this character deserves little respect for what they did, but without even so much as a scolding or a look of anger, the character gives his little apology and receives tearful instant forgiveness to the sound of sappy music."
"Which reminds me: while the plot got clich√© about two thirds of the way into the movie, the MUSIC was clich√© throughout."
Completely uninspired sappy elevator music typical of this type of movie.
"But neither of these really made me hate the movie overall, hence I still gave it a rating of 7/10."
A lot of good You can tell that this is the same director that did The Holiday - it's got the same magic.
Which is why I'm giving it 7 stars.
Made me laugh and cry.
"Good script, though I do feel that the film tries to do more than it has time for."
"With so much to get through, there are important relationships and characters that the film doesn't have time to make us become invested in."
Perfect casting of the leads.
Hathaway and especially De Niro were perfect.
"Anders Holm, however, was a let down - such an important role to get right, but what we got was a husband with no personality and dead eyes."
The ending didn't have the same impact because of this.
I also have to point out the awkward cinematography.
"I don't know if the DoP or director is to blame, it's weird because they both have great films under their belts."
I had to pause the film several times and just stare in amazement at how bad some of the shots were.
"There were adequate shots, but none that stood out as great."
"Finally, I wish the same effort had been put into the score as was put into The Holiday's score."
"Cringe Warning At the beginning, I felt good, but after a while all that cringe came in and ruined everything."
Interesting Internship I have been meaning to see this movie since it was released and finally I watched it and it was worth it.
The story line is so different.
"Its so simply and elegantly portrays the life of old people and need of change for them, providing opportunities to them, crediting them for their experience."
"Its teaches you to be open to change, explore the world but also at the same time be yourself."
"""Grey is the new Green"", very well said."
"I mean the things Ben said, how he dealt with everything was just a phenomenal example to us on how to handle certain situation."
"The light comedy, and the essence of changing technological world brings life to the movie."
"One ore thing it teaches you is to have hope, belief in you."
"Situations change, things become more complex, tension starts to build up but all you need is to have a me time and also talk to the one whom you can trust and who understands and then provides you with an honest and wise advise."
Silence speaks for itself and those silent moments in the movie give it a touch of reality.
"Loved it...

"Good movie, meh ending Im not going to spoil the ending for you, but i was very disappointed to say the least..

A Wonderful Inspirational Film I truly enjoyed this film and found it just when I needed it.
Ben's wife passed away some time ago and his return to the workforce reminded me to get up and face the day after my own husband's passing.
I also enjoyed his etiquette which he shared with the young men who were his co-workers.
"I felt that if Emily Post had a brother, it would be Ben Whittaker."
Since the first time I saw this film I've watched it at least 5 more times.
"Thank you to the cast, crew and their families for making this film possible."
Stores Nothing Great - if you have nothing to do this Weekend then it's a good option to go for.
Movie Review - The Intern - Stores Nothing Great Nancy Meyers has an old hand in making upper middle-age rom-com but this time she casually breezed into seniorities with her latest make 'The Intern'.
It's a collage of lighthearted merriment packed with mature actors.
The movie is based on cross-generation rendezvous.
"The movie consists stars like Di Niro and Anne Hathaway, yet it retains the affable tone of Meyer with upper-middle ambiance dedicated the well spruce homes."
The movie embarks with a promise.
"Ben Whittaker (Robert Di Niro) a 70-year-old widower, applies for a senior internship in an exuberant online fashion retail company held by a very assiduous micro-manger Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway).The movie has nothing new to showcase, it's just like Meyers previous flicks but with a tint of cross-generation element."
Both the actors did justice to the role but it's the story which laids back the movie.
Anne Hathaway is quite convincing and looks gorgeous as always.
Audience from all genres won't like the movie and if you have nothing to do this weekend then it's a good option to go for.

"How People Still Have Music In Them As long as one has music in himself, in his soul, one cannot help playing."
"It is true, instrument players - professional players - do not retire."
They live on their life's by making music everyday.
"It does not matter that they no longer do it on the stage, in front of people."
"They may give lessons for further generations but they never quit, they never drop their instrument once they retire."
Music flows through their veins and it is a part of whom they are.
They stop only when there is no more music in them.
"If there is one thing, for sure, that I will keep with myself after watching the movie The Intern, is the fact that we can always do something with our life, no matter the age, if you believe in yourself - you are kind - and you still ""have music in you""."
"I have watched the newly released movie, The Intern, at the beginning of this month at Cinema City in Kazimierz, with a dear sweet friend of mine."
"Some may name it a ""chick flick"" movie just because the main character is a lady running - successfully, if I may add - it's own company."
Let me mark that down: an online shopping site that grew from a one lady - show to 200 employees.
"As Jules, the leading character played by the Oscar winner Anne Hathaway, was stating right in the middle of the movie, you cannot name a site sexist / feminist / chick's site just by generalizing the fact that only women buy online!"
Same goes for chick flick movie status!
I think it is a lovely comedy with 2 amazing actors that are terribly and wonderfully old-school: Anne Hathaway (Jules) & Robert de Niro (Ben).
*** I was surprised and saddened that they both were not the first choices for the part.
The chemistry that they have on & off screen is lovely.
You can see throughout the interviews the respect that they have for one another.
The storyline is simple: Jules is a rising manager with a company in Brooklyn.
She owns an Internet page for online shopping.
Overall headcount of the company = 200 employees = a log of department and a lot of fuss for Jules.
It was quite funny and sad at the same time seeing her ride the bike in the office (instead of walking) just to save time...
The growth of the company makes people believe that they need a director to manage the things and keep Jules on the creative side.
The issue is that this might not be what Jules wants nor needs.
What I loved about this movie: - the actuality of it - I felt for Ben when he was trying to open up the Mac for the first time...
I am extremely proud to say that my mum and granny both have smart-phones and tablets.
"They have their very own Facebook accounts that they use on a daily basis - both for fun/ pleasure but also for keeping in touch with me and my sister, as we live abroad."
I know how hard it is for people to change from one system to another.
But I was told that precisely this is what keeps the brain alive :) - the somewhat - continuity of Ben's job - I loved Ben's connection with the old Brooklyn brick house where Jules 's company is currently residing.
"Ben used to work in the same building for several dozen if years, until he retired - they used to do phone books there."
He knows every nook of the place and now he has come back to it.
"It must feel very much like home... - Ben's old fashioned way of being - I love the old school chivalry, when men would escorted women, open the door for them, bring them flowers and smile delicately."
There is a scene I really love when Ben explains why men carry around with themselves handkerchiefs.
They never use them themselves so why do they bother?
"The handkerchiefs are carried for the ladies, in case they would need help - the delicate sex will always cry at a sentimental movie, for example :) I also love the scene where we get to see Ben's house, and especially his wardrobe - spotless and neatly arranged, with drawers and hangers that display all items."
The way he chooses his wardrobe each evening and prepares it for the next day... people don't do that anymore!
"- the difference between men and boys - or the difference between Ben and all his other colleges that have no clue what style is, even though they work in the fashion online environment."
"Wear s shirt, tuck it in, use a tie!"
"Those are some of the things that Ben teaches them ;) even Jules asks the question that for a long while was in my mind as well: ""where are the men now-days?"""
where are the men like Cary Grant or Harrison Ford?
"And why are we breeding only ""boys""?"
"Sad, but true, isn't it?"
"Predictable, Sappy, Corny, Loved It!"
"This movie was very predictable, very sappy and corny and I loved every minute of it."
I'm a Robert Dinero fan and enjoyed him in this role as well as Anne Hathaway.
"I was pleased that Anne Hathaway's character was in charge of her own company, however wasn't a ""B""."
"It didn't have any other well known actors (at least not known to me) but other than the two stars and Linda Lavin from Alice & Rene Russo, I didn't recognize any of the other actors."
"If you want to go see a movie and feel good afterwards, this is the one for you."
The average age of the audience when I attended was about 60.
"I went early in the day, so most of the viewers were probably retired like me."
"If you're under 30, I don't think this is the movie for you."
"Don't expect any earth shattering climaxes, don't want to spoil anything but like I said previously, the movie is predictable."
"Simple yet elegant The plot is superb, the movies shows you how experience is better at any stage,the importance of life is at little things and bot just keep running....how it important to value the life at each stage, and never lose hope."
Great movie The movie is great.
"It tells the story of a senior citizen that becomes an intern, in a funny and sympathetic way."
"There're alot of feelgood, enjoyable screens, and few scenes I disliked, or feeled cheesy."
The last scene of the movie was actually probably the only scene I didn't like.
Stunning Masterpiece At first I didn't except much of this movie but from the moment the caracters where introduced you feel that simphony with ben.
We learn that he has more to offer then what he looks like and that the office he worked at was his old workplace.
This is a must watch for anyone looking for a great movie.
learn!
"In the face of this movie, you will quickly realize that you are faced with an artistic and educational work full of good feelings, love, life, fun, and so on."
"The perspective of a busy woman, an experienced old man and a man with a lack of emotion helps you to understand people better."
A very nice breath of fresh air I really liked Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway in their roles.
"A very nice, genial, and lovely film that touches the human inside us."
De Niro charms his coworkers with his courteous manner and Hathaway is harried but lovely and lovable.
Two thumbs up.
"Ben, a 70-year old intern is a personal beck-and-call person to his 28-year old female boss."
"The Intern fails on its 'experience never gets old' tagline

The movie, with ""Experience never gets old"" plastered in huge bold capital letters on the posters - forgets the story line some 10 minutes into the movie."
"A 70-year old man, played by Robert De Niro bored of retirement, applies for an internship programme to have more and something new to do in life."
"And thus he enters into the life of some 200 20- something employees and their female boss, played by Anne Hathaway, at an e-commerce fashion company."
"There, he supports his 28-year old female boss tackle professional, social, and personal problems that come with cracking the glass-ceiling, becomes a personal driver to the boss, and acts as an agony- uncle to young co-workers."
Hathaway's character Jules is the main story - and how Ben's years of life and business experience is exactly what she needs to tackle her problems.
"He helps and helps, and gives away half a dozen of handkerchiefs to crying ladies in the film which tried to be feminist."
Ben came across as being used by the younger generation in the movie.
"Though he applied for the internship voluntarily, he ended up doing more work than the paid employees around - - thanks to his years of business knowledge, and his nature of wanting to be of use (he cleaned a messy table - without being asked - playing the typical role of an unpaid intern in real life!)"
He also becomes a personal beck-and-call person to Jules.
"At the end of the film, he takes a day off to get back to a yoga session with his retired mates who are previously shown very early in the film when he is planning to do something more interesting!"
"Clearly, the internship has nothing much to give to him in return, except, of course, a female masseuse as a friend."
"If you went to watch the film to see it make some kind of statement on life and motivation, if one is ever too old to work, and whether there is a limit to learning, you will find none of this here."
"Essentially, the movie remains a misplaced, mis- promoted film."
Definitely an easy watch.
"This film is not one that is pushing any boundaries or trying to be an award winning film, it is what is says on the tin, a light hearted, easy to watch film."
It provides numerous laughs and you identify enough with the characters to care what happens to them.
You want Robert de Niro to feel like he has something worthwhile to get up for everyday and you want Anne Hathaway to make the right choice both about her business and her family.
"And at the end, you feel satisfied that both characters have achieved these things."
De Niro and Hathaway give good performances as do the other actors in the film.
The plot is pretty good with some small twists and turns along the way.
"Overall, the film delivers what is promises and it's a enjoyable to watch too."
Perfect PERFECT MOVIE.
"IT'S WRITTEN BEAUTIFULLY, HAS GOOD DIRECTION, AWESOME ACTORS."
What else do you need in a movie if you have all these elements.
Really a must watch movie.
Tedious and weak directing.
Don't waste your time for watching this weak movie.
De Niro in a bad movie I wonder why such a great actor like De Niro took part in such a bad movie.
Another movie where the main character and the main child are complete saints.
"Well acted, decent story line."
But DeNiro's character is COMPLETELY without flaws.
How many people do you know like that in real life?.
And Anne Hathaway's daughter is just as sweet as can be.
Yuck!
I'm suck of that in movies.
"To me, it's lazy writing."
This movie deserves 8.5+ IMDB It was on my to be watched list for so long and finally I did.
Wow!
What a movie it is!
Sheer excellence.
Robert Di Niro - I loved him in this movie so much.
"A must watch movie for all the generations...
1 out of 2 found this helpful."
I wanted to see just a feel-good movie... and got more than I asked for!
I remember I went to the cinema in 2015...
"I read about the movie, and I liked the idea & the fact that De Nero & Hathaway are both in it..."
I wanted an escape from the usual action fiesta... so I picked The Intern and watched it...
It is one of the rare movies which gave me a real good feeling and positive energy...
"I enjoyed Ben's character, his congeniality, wisdom, and the positive influence, and how he positively affect all around him, even the dynamic Jules, although he's the older generation..."
"Since then, I've seen it more than once, and I'll keep watching it from time to time...

A light hearted movie The movie is simple.
"Clean and ESPECIALLY Robert's face expression ""oh boy""."
"The way of clothing is simply smart and at last this is movie if are bored with thiller, sci first etc and don't know what to watch."
"Great film for the family inc seniors :-) What a great film, De Nerio give a great performance paying Ben a retired widower who still has life and wants to live it."
Coming into a 21st Century tech industry with a 20th Century attitude he becomes a part of the company.
"Hathaway also give a touching performance as the company owner who fighting her own battle as a working mum with pressure of her business expanding resents Ben at first, but learns over the film what matters most."
"There are lots of underlying story lines through the film that work and bring the story to a pleasant end inc a Generational friendship, almost father daughter between De Nerio and Hathaway as well as inter company relations touching on some of the subjects foiling industry today."
The film is well written and should be likes by all.
"I think as a 21th Century adult I see allot of my Grandparents in De Nerio's character the film, with them just getting an iPad last year, I had to help them set up on facebook and the internet."
What once seemed like an impossible mission has become a reality and they now spend more time surfing the web then I do.
The film is also filled with great laugh out loud moments that touch home.
I think it's a film for the family inc your seniors.
"Warm and emotional movie,,, ,The elderly who had spent without age entering finds the last day digits and applies for internship and becomes unemployed ..."
"However, the president of the company is surprised to see the elderly people who are not at all think of interns."
"I have no other expectation, but ..."
But then a big change will happen after that ...
"This film is an elderly intern, young female president and company employees are shaggy movies ..."
"Actors are really wonderful, such as screenplays, acting, photography etc that truly digested their assigned casts ... again the two most important casts are intern (de niro) and female president (Anne Hathaway)."
The two actors really show their emotional and emotional appearance of life.
"Female president, it is really difficult to work with a family life and a company together, but here the mentor interns penetrate the place, feel pain and joy and felt in a heartfelt, gradually the female president seeking stability Well ... and I think that the company's employees and interns interact with each other, making it a fun and pleasant way to make life feel vibrant."
I think it is strongly recommended that many interns of age finally have considerable value and organize fulfilling life .... .
A Show For the Ages and the Differences Between Them This movie does not have a complicated story line.
A widower is bored with retirement and gets a job as an intern at an online clothing supplier.
"Because he is a class act, people begin to trust him and love him."
He teaches them another perspective about life.
"The story is nothing new or fantastic, but it is presented in a fun, humorous manner that draws you into the story (unless you are heartless and uncaring)."
The chemistry between the major characters works well.
"The most awkward character is the young intern, Davis."
"His personality seems to be undecided and incomplete, so he appears awkward."
"You can't be sure if he is exuberant and gay (unsure), or if he is just exuberant."
The actor playing the role goes with it and makes the most out of very little.
"The roles of Becky and Cameron are given more depth, yet, still one dimensional, really."
"They are fun to watch, but all the depth of the movie is shared between De Niro and Hathaway, with the exception of the husband."
He gets his moments to show depth as well.
"I didn't go to this movie looking for Oscar winning roles, script, or direction."
"De Niro is solid in his portrayal of this likable old man, and Hathaway displays her versatility by playing a fragile, successful woman, but I'd be surprised to find an Oscar nomination tossed their way."
The script just doesn't go that deep.
"If I had one complaint, that would be it."
"The script teases us with bits of information, enough for us to care about the characters, but that is all."
The movie is close to two hours long.
That could be a reason the script seems trimmed.
"Going to this movie is not about viewing some great achievement, it's about enjoying yourself for an afternoon (that's when I went)."
"I saw no unhappy, critical faces leaving the theater."
"Sadly, most of the movie's patrons were middle-aged or seniors."
"This movie deserves a wider audience because its overall purpose is to entertain by examining, humorously, the differences in generations, and it does a great job of it."
Had potential but did not deliver It's not every day that one comes across a movie like The Intern.
"The concept of senior citizens opting to come out of retirement and reboot their careers is a fresh one, which is what the movie centers on."
"The movie also boasts of having 2 reputable actors to its name, Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway."
So it can be said that the movie was all set up to be a memorable experience.
"However, somewhere along the way it stumbles miserably in its execution."
"Robert De Niro plays Ben Whittaker, a 70-year-old widower, who decides that he's had enough of the lifestyle of a retiree, and opts to refresh his career when he comes across an opportunity to work as a senior citizen in a growing online fashion startup."
This entire sequence of events takes place in the first 5-10 minutes of the movie.
"He eventually applies and gets in with ease, which takes place in another 5-10 minutes of the movie."
No problems there.
"He is eager to learn and has adjusted comfortably to the 21st century, except he dresses in an old-fashioned manner, which his colleagues initially make light of."
So where's the conflict?
"Anne Hathaway plays Jules Ostin, a twenty-something CEO of a rising online fashion startup."
"She is entirely career-driven, which takes a toll on her relationships with her family and even with her employees."
"We see the career-driven side of Jules, but we are basically just told everything we need to know about her in about 5-10 minutes."
"We don't really get much exposure to her back-story, which would have really strengthened the character."
"This, again, weakens the point of conflict in the story and the character development."
"If the issue with actually developing the characters and slowing down the pace of the movie was risking making the movie over 2 hours in length, then it would have been better to cut out the number of issues to address and instead focus on 2-3 main plot points."
This would have made it easier for us to empathize with the characters and the situations they found themselves in.
"As I said before, however, the casting directors were on point, as I found the performances to be the one main strength of the movie."
"Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway were cast perfectly as Ben and Jules, respectively, and I could not have imagined anyone else who would have done the roles justice."
"The two seem to ease into their roles without much difficulty and give natural, sincere performances."
"Overall, The Intern was backed by a fresh, novel concept and strong performances."
But what it struggled with was a rushed execution and the need for the writers to jam in and address an unnecessarily large number of 21st century issues.
It would have been more effective for the movie to instead focus on 2-3 core plot points.
"For me it was Excellent For me it was excellent, nothing but a beautiful life lesson with an awesome music track, so incredible well done and socially critical for people of all ages, I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end, no excessively dramatic, nor too intellectually cold, it has a perfect balance between human emotions and reasonable decisions, I so wish my life could be like that, and the relations ships were meaningful but with the proper amount of sensible and sensitive, like the pepper and salt of life, wonderfully paced, my only criticism is that it was lack of details on the problems solutions and follow ups, but they weren't necessary for the message it tried to deliver as far as I can see; in short a surprisingly and refreshing classy, well done, mature movie, executed with excellence, and exemplary pattern to follow for Hollywood."
"Absolutely delightful For a long time, there hasn't been a movie I would call as 'Gentle' in its presentation and tone."
This movie has all the ingredients in the right proportion sans sex and violence.
Not mushy type though.
Great story rendered with great fineness.
Admired wonderful acting by Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway.
JoJo Kushner is simply adorable.
"Here is a film, a fiction, that you can believe it to be true."
Amazing to see how flawlessly the story has been woven.
Inter action of people of two different generations has been so nicely depicted.
Impressive ways to highlight the good of two different generations.
Highlighting the good of each not disrespecting the other.
One more movie to be added in my personal collection for worth keeping it for long time.
Worth watching once.
"Robert De Niro pulls it off like no one else ever could, but the story leaves something to be desired Robert De Niro taking the role of the modern day Uncle Iroh is something that everyone needs, a supportive wise guide to help you deal with the stresses of life."
"The storyline and set up is good too, but the movie leaves a lot to be desired in terms of a story, it feels as if there was almost no conclusion to the story, little internal/external conflict."
"Sure, there were some conflicts but there was no real objective or plot that the movie moved towards, almost as if it was a filler episode in a sitcom, it severely lacked a sense of substance and direction."
"To be honest, the movie was very moving and touching but left me feeling as if the story wasn't complete."
"Great Chemistry and some good humour make it a fuzzy experience SHORT REVIEW- RATING - 3.5/5

Nancy Meyers' latest flick is satisfying and very funny."
Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway have great chemistry which is the main plus point for the movie.
It doesn't rely on slapstick humour and actually gives some good clean jokes.
the scene where they break into Jules' mom's house if hilarious and the dialogue is pretty commendable.
"However, in the final act, there is a twist which almost ruins the fun of the movie and the movie takes a much more emotional toll."
+ Great Chemistry + Good Humour + Fast pace - Third Act's small twist - Tonal changes towards the end - unnecessary love track between DeNiro and Russo
Sweetest Movie Ever Seen!!
I must start off this review by saying that this is by far the cutest real life movie I have ever seen!
Robert De Niro plays such a kind character who is so wise and helpful in every way possible.
And Anne Hathaway was a brilliant CEO who portrays a woman of strength and power.
"However, this also movie shows the flip side of having a powerful woman running a business and not having much time for her husband."
Ben (Robert De Niro) helps Jules (Anne Hathaway) not only with the company but also with her personal life and shows Jules that she can be a powerful CEO of a company without having to lose her position for her husband.
He also manages to help almost everyone he meets!
He is generally a very lovable character.
"This movie is a must watch for anyone who wants an easy, relaxing and heart warming plot."
"Average Joe Boring beginning, great middle, crap ending."
Some belly laughs from Adam Devine who should have had a bigger part - he is hilarious.
"Robert De Niro was pretty good but we were rooting for him to die or get the job at the end, the actual ending was one of those nothing-really-happens ones."
Anne Hathaway was back to her devil wears prada role which I love her for.
A good ish film if you fancy light background fodder but not one I'm likely to remember in a few days.
"Must see movie I came into this move with no expectations, but I have to say this movie was awesome."
Its a must watch.
Very funny and all the actors played great roles.
I never expected for Robert Deniro to be funny but he definitely was.
"This was a real comedy and I have not seen a real comedy like this in a long time, and a real comedy meaning its just more and more laughter."
There is a little bit of like romance in it but most comedies these days have romance in them.
Most of all Anne Hathaway was great as well.
There are a lot of well known faces that you will see and there all great.
So anybody who doubts this movie please go rent it or whatever and you will not be disappointed I can promise you that.
Take it from me because if I'm writing an actual review then it had to be really good because I don't do this normally.
"Nancy Meyers - Yea, I'll watch it Something new, refreshing, perfect to kick back and enjoy, can really make Your day and possibly make You rethink Your ways at Your job."
"Positive energy, love, perfect contrast of modern and old schools styles, gorgeous Anne, De Niro whose only face expressions are enough for perfect performance."
I would suggest this movie to everyone.
Fabulous take on many things all together.
"An old-school retired executive meets a new-age Tech CEO and both the world's come together gracefully, learning from eachother, appreciating and complimenting eachother."
Robert De Niro is an absolute charm and it appears he didn't even had to adapt a single trait to play this character.
He is just made for it.
Anne Hathaway from being an intern turn close associate in her early days to being the CEO herself.
Anne Hathaway carried the whole role so enigmatically.
"A modern age woman who is ambitious and balances her work life, her family time, her employees and her relationship with everyone."
"The support cast was good aswell, a few bits more in 5-10 mins extra screentime would have been great."
"Despite being beautiful in her simplicity, a few more fashionista montages of Anne Hathaway purely as fan service or for people who have massive crush on her, would have been the cherry on the cake."
"The overall chemistry of the characters especially the lead stars was amazing, the character development was top-notch especially from Anne's character perspective, a few scenes of Robert's character taking up the modern take, wearing Tshirt to the office, listening to modern music would have added a little more shine."
Overall a great experience.
Worth the time.
People should watch it for the fun of it.
"As I said two years ago, 'I loved it.'"
Did I really write 'Robert De Nero'?
"I did and I apologise, Mr. De Niro."
I read the first dozen or so reviews and most were negative; wrongly so in my opinion.
"I wonder if the writers of those negative reviews failed to understand the purpose of the film and wrote subjective, rather than objective, critiques from a clich√©d masculine and born of youth inexperienced standpoint."
I enjoyed the film immensely as indeed I enjoyed the screenplay.
"I suspect that some reviewers failed to realise that the entire film is intended to be seen from the point of view of a seventy year old man with a lifetime of experience that those younger reviewers completely fail to comprehend, let alone understand."
Watch it and enjoy it and push negativity out of your life.
Robert De Nero and Anne Hathaway are consummate in their performances.
"Very relaxing, very delightful and fulfilling!"
The Intern is a super cool movie about how we can fall in love with seniors and not take them for granted.
"The screenplay is without any loopholes, the story is good, and the acting is stunning."
"Robert De Niro is a great actor, and this movie shows he hasn't lost his touch."
"Anne Hathway is the perfect business woman, and I feel nobody else could do the job so well done."
This movie has everything for comedy lovers and the serious watchers.
"Sometimes it gets emotional, but most of the times its funny and relaxing."
The director has also done a great job.
"The movie has a nice soundtrack, and the locations are also cool."
"I cannot anymore about this movie, simply love it."
"Heart Warming and funny, until the ending!?"
Nice story about the intermingling of two generations and the accompanying contrasts and conflicts.
"However, I had some issues with the way the story ended."
"The movie introduced a number of interesting characters for whom we developed a semblance of care and connection, but ended the film without following any of them to some logical conclusion."
"The relationships being developed by the assistant, the masseuse, the chauffeur, the young intern were all ripe for development, but left the viewers hanging."
The facial expressions of the audience on the way out of the theater confirmed the fact that the movie ended too soon.
So cute This movie is so cute the cast is so good and it's just the right amount of funny and heartwarming.
A Incredible breath of fresh air!
Suitable to watch for many occasions!
First off I wanted to start by saying this movies genre is not the typical type I usually lean towards.
When it comes to Hathaway movies Love & Other Drugs is the first one that comes to mind as a favorite.
Anyways being a big movie watcher.
On I have always rated watched movies & TV shows but up until recently have never left written reviews.
Well being a big fan of both Hathaway and DeNiro.
I was surprised in 2020 that I had not seen this movie.
"Sometimes when I'm having trouble finding something to watch, one way I find something is I will look up one of my favorite actresses or actor and watch a movie starring them."
Now it was a bonus finding a movie relating to the genre I needed to watch.
"With all the cruel people I have been forced to deal with lately it felt good watching ""The Intern""."
The chemistry that DeNiro & Hathaway bring to the screen is a breath of fresh air!
Loved the plot and how even though this is a work of fiction.
I just love how DeNiro uses many now obsolete norms of the past in a modern hipster style tech setting.
I think this movie would be a good pick to watch on nearly any occasion.
If you have a partner or children who stare at their cellphone screens like robots this is a must watch.
If you want some pointers on how to be a gentleman this is a must watch.
If your just looking for a feel good movie this is a must watch.
Well I hope this was some help.
Good Day!
Good Sunday Movie Plot: I think this movie is good to watch while you feel lazy and would like to watch something laid back.
"Although, I expected better comedy in the movie."
I think there are a lot of funny situations that could have been created for this movie.
"Now, the idea of a woman be the CEO of a company while her husband stays at home is pretty good as there is a big movement for equality at work between women and men."
The movie should have shown more on how she created her company and became CEO.
"Also, more interaction in the conflicts the CEO experience with stay at home moms."
This would show more the problem with stereotypes and old school mentality vs new school.
Acting: I think the acting is pretty good.
"Of course, the main actors are Oscars winners with a lot of experience."
Overall: It is an OK movie where it could have been better in many ways as aforementioned.
I hope main actors get to do another and more serious movie.
An older man is appointed as an intern at a start-up and finds he is needed more than he might think.
De Niro is so damn Adorable!
"Loved it 'The Intern' is just the perfect go-to feel-goody movie that might just lighten up your day, along with some subtle sweet relatable things to take home to."
"Ben Whittaker, our perfect gentleman, saying the right things, doing the right things, in his 71st year, does inspire a lot; but sometimes too idealistic for my taste."
"Though sometimes, it doesn't hurt seeing a perfect mentor to our ever-so-stressed Jules."
"Ben's perfection, maturity and finesse in handling things actually allows the film to focus more on the Jules' plotline, adding little to his own character arc, which might iritate some, just barely."
"The humor is just adequate, not slapstick, just subtle chuckle-humor, perfectly complementing the lightheadedness of this flick."
"Turn on the AC, bring your family, take out that beer from the fridge, sit-back and get ready to have some quality relaxation time."
THE WORST MOVIE THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.
DO NOT WASTE TIME WATCHING IT.

Sequel Needed After watching this movie i had tears in my eye.
i feel this is one that should have a sequel which would make everyone cry.
Disguised political correctness A praise to women emancipation castrating men into beta males who play life-roles like mother and are emotionally immature and unbalanced.
De Niro represents the old school of men already dying and giving place to the new hipster metro-sexual boys.
Hathaway plays an alpha-woman role very sensitive but neurotic too.
"This is a political correctness film, very well disguised by tenderness and pseudo-drama."
Typical of Hollywood modern films undermining the traditional roles of sexes in the western world.
The only plus of the film was De Niro.
Calm and balanced.
"Self-confident, wise and experienced."
Lovely Nice and warm movie with excellent actors.
I was stunned reading other peoples bad reviews.
I just loved it being not too predictable and leave you with a smile on your face in the end.
"Nothing more, nothing less."
Absolutely not necessary to spend a 1000 words on criticizing a basically happy movie!
"Humor, and chemistry in the workplace Review:

Movie 'The Intern'

Movie poster and movie concept is attractive and I damned sure you will love to watch it!"
You know 'Robert De Niro' ( Ben) & 'Anne Hathaway' (Jules) chemistry in this movie are adorable.
"Ben is a window and retired man, and at the age of '65', he applied for a job in this modern world Where people are working on laptops."
He wants to work in a new world environment.
He was assigned Intern for Jules.
But Jules doesn't liked work with older people.
But She is a hard-working person and Ben respect that.
He worked with smile and energy in this workplace and Jules likes his honesty and share her life hard and tough time with him..and finally she accepted him as her Intern.. story is more than my views.
You will love it.
A feel good venture!
I just love the way De Niro and Anna Hathaway interacts with each other.
"If your mood is not okay,then I suggest you to go for it and smile!"
What made me raise eyebrow The female protagonist chose to forgive & stay w her husband who cheated on her.
Don't ppl say that there's only 0 times of cheating on someone or infinite # of times?
You cannot fix a lopsided table by turning it around!
"There are many reasons to use the word 'shallow' to describe a film, but I will use it for a straightforward reason."
"If something is wrong, you cannot make exceptions unless you give a legit reason for it; otherwise, all you do is what this film does: you turn the problem around and end up where you started, only with the toppings of 'niceness' and 'feel-goodness'."
"This film shows the practice of reversing traditional position of man and woman, and when it encounters the same old problems, it simply changes the narrative."
"This way, something that was wrong before now is just, because the one doing it is a different person."
"The stay-at-home man nags about her spouse putting her work first, complains about her not spending enough time with the family, and cheats (of course, a classic move, right!?)."
But the film insists that it is not in any way the workaholic wife's fault for not paying enough attention to her husband and their daughter.
"On the other hand, the woman is convinced by this narrative that she should not consider any adjustments on her side because this is all on him."
"To put it short, it is clear that nobody likes and wants the 'stay-at-home' job, at least not in this format, just like nobody wants to be an 'employee.'"
But it is impossible to make everybody an employer; it defeats the whole purpose of the employer-employee structure.
Then what is to be done?
"The answer is simple and, at the same time, may sound fantastical to some: fix the unequal legs of the table instead of turning it around."
A beautiful feel good and inspiring movie I am writing this review while my feelings about this movie remains fresh and warm.
And boy it makes you feel so positive and so good even if you are not in your best of spirits as I was quite ill while i saw this.
"The scenes are utmost beautiful, the acting captivating and there are quite some messages that are being thrown out to our generation."
"First out, I was not a particular fan of Robert De Niro till now, my ignorance obviously, but he literally blew me away with his screen presence and subtle expressions."
There is unarguably no one in this whole world who could have done better justice to this role as he has.
He is an epitome of being a gentleman- one who says the right things at the right times - and through him the film shows what experience brings to the table.
"Even the trifle things he does affects you like for example being compelled to tuck in your shirts all the time or carry around a crisply folded hanky, so on and so forth .His expressions are so self explanatory and transparent and it truly demonstrates what a fine artist he is."
Anne Hathaway shines in every way.
I wondered why their faces or why their ears blushed red all the time when the emotions were high.
And i believe it is the commitment and the warmth that comes when the actors are living and not acting the moments.
"She addresses issues such as sexism feminism and a working woman's quandary over pursuing your dreams or compromising them for your family, just to name few , with ease."
The other cast were equally superb and everyone deserves a mention.
Special mention also goes out to the captivating cinematography the casting and the perfectly blending background scores.
A complete package in every technical area that one could never find fault in.
"Overall I would highly recommend it to anyone; as this film is a true to life film that sticks to its theme always, one that is more beautiful than its cast , that leaves you with a smile, and most importantly one that makes you write your first film review."
Great Movie I absolutely loved this movie!
"Here are my reasons why

1."
It is such a sweet movie about finding friends you never expected to have and still having life left in you.
It shows you the balance of life in such a different way and view and that you can do anything no matter your age or gender.
It shows that running your own business can be difficult at times but you have friends and family to support you along the way.
Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway give a great performance to this movie because of their great acting skills and connection towards their characters friendship.
Throughout the movie you see their friendship grow into family.
I thought that Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro really stepped it up in terms of engaging with their characters and making it look believable.
There are so many twists and surprises along the way that you never thought could happen.
I thought Nancy Meyers ( directer and writer) wrote an incredibly entertaining movie and directed it very well.
"If I could watch this over and over again I would because it is so incredibly entertaining, truthful and sweet."
So there you have it one of the best movies I have ever watched!
Oboy Poor manuscript.
Poor casting!
De Niro keeps it alive!
"This film is mostly alright I knew very little about this film going in, but found it to be a decent enough film with decent enough acting and a decent enough plot."
"There's some lightly humourous moments throughout with many, obviously, planted in the generational divide."
It does contain some quite well-delivered sympathetic moments as well.
One of my favourite parts was the recommendation to always carry a handkerchief with you in case someone needs it as I live to a similar code.
I would have liked one or two more scenes with Rene Russo and i think it could have done without the 'cheating' plot line.
I was honesty marvelling at it being a rare film without some form of bad guy up to that point.
It would have been quite refreshing and would have earned a seven from me otherwise.
Nice and nicely done.
"A retired widower, Ben, starts a new job as an intern in an online fashion retailer company run by, Jules, the workaholic super committed young lady."
The two of them get encountered as Ben becomes Jules's personal intern.
"Following his looks and the way he dressed, Jules thought Ben can't offer much nether to her, nor to her company."
"So, she gave him the least amount of tasks."
Surprisingly he catches her attention after he managed to voluntarily arrange a disk that has been always found unarranged.
"Subsequently, Ben becomes her right hand who is responsible for each aspect of her life, starting from getting her daughter to and from school, to breaking into her mother's house to delete an email sent to her by mistake from Jules."
"Eventually, his guidance helps her bringing her life together."
"It's a nice drama/light movie about starting over, and how people could do more regardless their age or problems."
"However, the journey for Ben, the leading role wasn't much of a struggle."
"Which brings us to wonder, whose story it was?"
"Ben, or Jules's?"
"Ben didn't do much to blend in, while the effort Jules had to do to amend her marriage, sort things out in her company, and bringing her life together was much in comparison to the challenges Ben went through."
"He didn't fail, not even once in any of his tasks."
"He drew a line of wisdom, comfort, and trust through the whole movie, yet, it was a bit difficult to believe."
"Especially, when he mentioned at the beginning of the movie that he used to call his grandson to ask him what the heck is a USB, but we see him smoothly using a laptop, doing emails, and he even changed from an old SAMSUNG to an iPhone with no much of a struggle."
"It's a nice movie indeed, that drew a smile and a relief following the happy ending."
Very sweet Great movie!
"I loved watching de niro and anne bonding like that

"In 2021, this movie touch me a lot In 2020 a pandemic covid virus hits the world."
Every people got affected.
"In 2021, last May my dad passed away, in June i've been demolished by office due to slow income and cut some senior staff."
"And what i'm thinking, this movie inspires me, that i still have potential."
One of the best feel good movie.
If you are here to decide about watching this movie i would recommend you to go for it.
I am a 100 % sure that at the end of the movie u feel so good and light hearted.
"Great movie Great movie never regret to watch , and the company very nice and its a bit comedy

Enjoyed it!
"My husband and I just saw this movie and went in having read some reviews here thinking it might not be so good, but we REALLY enjoyed it!!"
So I am purposely coming back to review this movie positively with that in mind.
Great chemistry between the two main characters and cleaver concept of a storyline of a senior intern working for a young business founder.
"We found it pretty realistic about the fast pace of today's businesses and the conceived value of a younger workforce that understands technology and a fast and exorbitant work pace, with the older generation's experience being taken for granted."
And enjoyed a nice exploration of the two generations' approach to work style and how the old and new can work together and build off of each other.
Two thumbs up from us!
Nice film.
"Maybe this movie is not one of the greats, but it's quite funny, I think is very nice film."
"Robert give us a good performance as usual, with a excellent combination with Ann, with a fantastic result which deliver us an acceptable comedy film."
"Sometimes the actors' performance is not precisely convincing, but at the end, story yes it is, forceful."
"Robert gave us an charming performance a bit difficult to believe, because we are not used to seeing him with this kind of roles, but he did marvelous as a great actor as he is."
"In contrast, we are used to seeing to Ann in this sort of films but in this case, not in the main role as comedy actress, rather as a dramatic actress in certain manner."
not something I do every day I have been to see this film at the theatres twice now.
that doesn't happen often.
I can truthfully say that this is one of the best films that I have seen Robert DeNiro in and Anne Hathaway gives a great performance as well.
Both my wife and myself left the theatre thinking that this was perhaps the best movie we have seen all year.
It goes to show that you CAN produce a movie without the gratuitous swearing and sex and still come out with a product that will entice viewers to want to see it and in all likelihood purchase it when it comes out on video.
"I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone as a feel good viewing choice along the lines of a blind side, pretty woman or nottinghill."
"Good Heart warming movie This movie is definitely a fun date night, I believe."
This movie just make you laugh out loud numerous of times.
The storyline of is funny and characters were funny.
There was some flosses that could been on better but overall this movie is a great laugh out loud movie for anyone.
Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway were great in the movie.
It touches almost every aspect of someone's life.
We are working in a busy world with busy lives.
Even we don't know 100% what is going on with our lives anymore.
This is a good movie which tells us that we should balance the work and life and also we should not take quick decisions thinking that they will make everything better than what it is now.
It also reminds that what our old people knows about the work and life is really far away from what we think they know.
"It can be a Drama or Comedy but the abstract information it gives us spreads all over ones life; working, parenting, entrepreneurship, family, friends, passion, sacrificing and many more."
"Inspiring and a good story The movie from the beginning, manages an interesting concept showing the difficulty of older people for employment in a society where everything is modernized and simplified by the internet and computer access, the relationship between the fellow and jules from the outset was noted tense as she and her direct boss never sent the mail asking for help, but despite this the help without anyone asked and there started a healing and inspiring friendship between two people of different ages, the movie has a good script , each supporting character played an important role, if you want to see a family movie or inspiring this is the one."
Loved De Niro's character more than movie The Intern is entirely a sweet plot with some more sugar of Ben(De Niro).
I liked its character more than its plot spcly the lead.
Anne has done a great work in it and relationship between then is just awesome.
"Ben is a character whom we all want to be in our real life , A loved one who knows what to say and do in the right spot."
Though there are some plot holes but its all right.
I decided to watch the movie just because of Hathway but when i finished i loved De Niro more in the movie.
"crinkly charm i liked ""intern"" and i can be a harsh critic at times but listening to the script and focusing on some detail do give this flick an interesting edge."
"Being old myself and retired (55) i can relate to the need to keep occupied and use my time well ,De Niro's character reflected those issues well by his routine and habits and genuine excitement at the prospect of being back in the roller coaster world of work."
"Ben has nothing to prove and is secure but obviously lonely and feels isolated ,even though he does have some unwanted attention..De Niro sets a nice tone with his well proved facial expressions and gradually becomes liked by his colleagues_x0085_.the first few scenes convey the uncertainty of the young staff with an older person present_x0085_.i think there is a message in this re culture and our need to keep moving on, forgetting the benefits of experience and old age ,doesn't just mean drooling and demise ."
"The relationships Ben has with his colleagues is touching and meaningful ,leading to the advice that would otherwise be unavailable and the young staffs reliance on media for conversation and communication is challenged !"
"Hopefully, humans will not forget to speak one to one?"
Hathaway is slightly manic but absorbing and dedicated as a focused entrepreneur should be .
The touches of emotion under pressure were presented well.
"Funny moments were regular,highly amusing but not frequent enough _x0085_.. but is new york devoid of black folk ,i think not ,so maybe in the casting should have chosen more wisely ,as black faces were few and generally in the background?"
".for such a low budget of 40m ""intern"" is watchable and moving and worth a punt,but don't expect visual mayhem just a gentle ride with moments of humour and charm?"
"Flat Sad seeing Robert not knowing what he's doing in the movie

Not exactly compelling You keep expecting something to happen.
And sometimes it almost does.
I'm a big fan of both De Niro and Hathaway so maybe I was expecting too much.
"I mean, I was expecting Something."
But what I got was only a little better than nothing.
"Enjoyable almost nothing, you understand, Robert and Anne have never been less than enjoyable, but the drama here is almost inconsequential."
"At least, I hoped that when something did happen De Niro's character would have something to do with its solution."
"Not so, the problem (you'll have to look hard to find it) is solved by the two characters themselves with no input from the title character."
"What we have is a group of nice likeable people being nice and likeable and doing nice and likeable things, but all that happens (SPOILER ALERT, FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE PICTURE) is that Quintessential Type A Anne/Jules is overworked and laid-back Robert/Ben helps her deal with this, occasionally dispensing poils of wisdom to the kids from his 70-year vantage point."
That's it.
"Oh, there's some marriage difficulties that almost become drama but not quite, they're solved without even a discussion."
"If you're looking for relief from edgy high tension drama like ""Mama Mia II"" or ""Ocean's 8"" this is the picture for you."
"But you don't get out much, do you?"
No point movie Nothing really happens in entire movie.
2 hours waiting for something...
But...?
"Humorous Very entertaining, DeNiro good, Many laughs, Couldn't second guess plot, loved the cast, simple engineering is best in plots, touching, emotionally satisfying, good ending - what really was well planned was the use of the automobile driving scenes, they seemed to tie together the plot and relationships, it must have been hard to figure out if the audience is going to stay with the plot as it unfolds when we live in a time where they over engineer special effects and try to make unreal jumps in here-to-there moves in the scenes to tie it all together."
I liked that they used simpler environments and concentrated on story-telling of the cast so that the relationships could be expanded to realistic levels.
"This means that they were able to give the feeling of real people, not surreal."
"awesome The film is lovely, its sweet, warm hearted and just so lovely."
"The whole films from start to end has a few personal issues of realism, IE how companies work and process, but thats me being picky with attention to detail."
"The relationship between the two main characters has such depth that you can forgive the lack of understanding in the other areas, and its beautiful to see it blossom from the start you see there is a spark between then and the film managed to keep you wanting to find out whats happening next, to some extent you can guess and maybe figure it out, but all in all this is one of the best films like this iv seen in years, 8/10

"Excelente Amazing movie, so passionate."
I love everything about it.
Wonderful!
Such a wonderful acting of De Niro & Anne Hathaway.
All these among a good and entertaining story made me totally satisfied as a Comedy - Drama Movie.
Terrific!
"Initially was not sure I would like it, but was pleasantly surprised."
It is a terrific storyline that is both entertaining and well made.
The acting was also top-notch.
I liked seeing Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway in this movie together.
They played their respective parts very well.
"I will not give away any spoilers, but there were certainly parts of this movie that I did not see coming."
There are parts that will make you happy and at other times sad.
This film had my attention the entire time.
"When the credits started rolling, I thought ""I want to watch this again."""
I would highly recommend it!
"robert is a mafia overlorddd Cmon in brother de niero is a mafia boss lol, i literally dont want to him as a lmao intern so ROFL!!"
But i believe the movie is decent one not an oscar winning act shown there but really good movie not better the godfather.
"It's beautiful It had a beautiful plot, extremely talented actors and a simple yet comforting execution."
"Honestly, it calmed my anxious mind and I can't be more thankful that I chose this movie for the night."
Perfect movie The characters and the plot is so perfect.
This movie made my day!
"Seizing an opportunity to get back in the game, he becomes a senior intern at an online fashion site, founded and run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) - a true barnstormer of a creative personality obsessed with her success of her start up business."
"Jules is married to a stay at home dad (Anders Holm) and has a spunky child, but her work seems to take precedence - until the concept of a senior intern is forced upon her."
"The supporting cast - Rene Russo (the office masseuse), Andrew Rannells, Adam DeVine, Zach Pearlman, Jason Orley, Christina Scherer, Nat Wolff, Celia Weston et al - is to the person terrific."
Superb masterpiece For this movie few sentences are enough.
"Superb masterpiece, digging right into your soul and heart."
"Something that modern cinematography has lost years ago, I only wish there are more movies like this."
"Excellent acting, touchy story and funny."
I recommend you watch this during rainy Sunday afternoon with your loved one.
This movie makes you think about important things in your life.
Also for younger audience it as good example what life looked like when we are weren't chasing careers and wealth.
"It shows that nice behavior, hard working and kindness to people around us can bring something more awarding that success and money."
Heart warming...
I never thought that this movie will be like this emotional and sensational.
I really admire the Ben Whittaker character.
"Helpful, thoughtful, leading man."
Made me think humanity and the value of these things again.
"Plus, his thinking of his wife got me tears in some scenes because I felt really sorry for him."
Script is really good.
Things are happening in perfect order.
"And I never got bored, not even single second."
Didn't expect this much great title before watching.
"Words not enough, you just have to watch and feel that pure and sweet ambience."
Another Robert De Niro masterpiece I think.
Please watch it with your love ones... 10/10.
A feel good movie I enjoyed watching.
I'm beginning to write more and more reviews because of all the poor reviews I have read on IMDb that has been misleading viewers.
"People this isn't a Oscar winning movie, its not Casablanca."
"It's not going to leave you in tears, while winning award after award."
"But what it is, is a really good film."
It makes you feel good.
Great actors and a really good plot that develops characters in a way where you get to know them.
Sometimes you want to be able to watch a movie and just enjoy it.
"Not have to decode it, or debate it, but just be able to relax and watch it."
"So that's what this movie, a nice enjoyable film where Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway have great chemistry and leave you with a smile."
A retired De Niro joins a thriving online fashion business with Hathaway and the two make for a great film.
"Ignore the haters, De Niro has not lost his magic, and Hathaway is always a breath of fresh air."
"A simple, yet beautiful story!"
"Although I got this movie last year, I couldn't bring myself to watch it until today."
"I didn't expect much of the movie because I'm usually a fantasy type of guy, but boy was I wrong."
"As the title says, it's a simple movie, easygoing, funny and smart."
I'm a big De Niro fan and after this movie I'm even more so.
Anne and Robert really have have a great acting chemistry going on and I'd love to see a movie starring these two again one day.
I don't want to spoil anything so I'm just gonna say that I felt really good after watching this because the movie just makes you feel so.
"It's good art, so if you're looking for a relaxing piece for yourself or your family you can't go wrong with this one!"
You won't regret watching this!
"When I see ""heartwarming"" in the film description I carefully avoid the title as it usually stays for ""your bowels will float out of your body with boredom"" ""attention: silence interlaced with nonsensical babbling in artistic sceneries"" , ""women pretending to be best friends at some countryside"", ""characters so insipid you will feel sick"" and ""cheesy happy ending alert / no idea for ending at all"" ."
"This film however, is SO MUCH DIFFERENT than a typical mawkish comedy-drama: ingeniously played, authentic, unobvious and naive just in the right dose."
I savoured every single minute of it and it was definitely the most positive thing I have watched for ages!
"The Intern is an instant day- maker and a true heart-warmer that urges you to be happy with life, act nice to people and become a better person for at least a couple of hours."
Great job!!
A Brilliant Heart-warming Movie!!!!
"Well after seeing the high rating score that the movie had managed to grasp, I sat down to watch the movie with really high hopes of getting a good laugh from it."
But what happened was even more amazing.
Its a classic tale of how we benefit from the wisdom of our elders.The movie went from one scene to another seamlessly and was able to retain my attention with utmost ease.
"Many feminists might disagree with me but being a high roller is a tough job, be a man or a woman."
And especially in the current trend of start-up companies.
"But the way it was done, especially by the ball-buster (yet still vulnerable) character that Anne Hathaway played lent not only an air of authenticity but raised the movie standards to a whole another bar."
"And last but never the least, was the character played by Robert De Niro which makes me wish I would be half as mature and still so full of life when I reach the age of his character."
"Overall a brilliant production that does deserve a one time watch, if not twice or thrice."
Promising plot and promising beginning The movie starts off as with refreshing concept and gets you hitched early on.
The concept of a senior citizen intern was completely new to me and I was curious to how Ben's (Robert De Niro) life will change with the internship how he will contribute and everything was quite interesting to imagine.
As the movie progressed Robert De Niro was superb and half of the movie is engaging because of him.
I believe the story could have been written and painted in a million ways.I just feel the plot had more potential than what is executed.
The way the startup culture is depicted and the filming of a startup's work culture is quite brilliant.
I loved the ending.
It is almost perfect (no spoilers here).
While watching at times I felt maybe the movie is digressing a little but still it was engaging and entertaining.
Hats off to Nancy Meyer's for coming up with such interesting plot and story.
Must Watch!
"The Intern is such a heartwarming movie, and hilarious at the same time."
It is also one of the most realistic 21st century movies to-date.
"Robert De Niro did a great job, although that's no surprise."
"But Anne Hathaway did a marvelous job acting out her character, I mean she made me fall in love with her character!"
"It goes without saying that I'm neither a fan of the two lead actors, as well as I'm usually a big movie skeptical when it comes to acting the characters as required, so she beyond impressed me."
"I'd also like to note that this is my first IMDb review of a movie ever, that is because I rarely ever take the time to write any review about any movie."
"But this movie is just that special that makes you want to thank the directing team, cast team and anyone involved in making this movie possible."
"Also if you haven't watched this movie yet, stop reading reviews because I guarantee you'll enjoy it."
Finally!
A GREAT Movie!!!
I promise - no spoilers... Just two hours of funny!
This was the BEST movie I've seen in 2 years!
"It was well written, great acting, and some real laugh out loud moments!!!"
It's a movie you'll see more than once!!!!
"Mr. deNero played the gentleman- the ""senior"" intern after retiring and figuring out..."
It's not all it's cracked up to be.
Anne Hathaway is the young entrepreneur with a booming Internet business growing at a rapid pace- almost too fast.
Surrounded by a great cast - some known... And not so know...
"They company decides to hire ""senior interns"" at which DeNero is a perfect fit.... To intern for the boss, that is."
"Scenarios and laughs ensue, so grab your friends, sit back, munch your popcorn and enjoy!"
"Anne at her best Disappointing ending, no way she can stay with her husband!!"
"Otherwise it's a good film, Anne is always passionate."
A brilliant film.
So.
I waited a long time for this movie to apear on screen and it totally worth it.
I knew it will be an interesting movie from the trailer and from the fact that is featuring two fun to watch and interesting actors that i always enjoy watching: Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway.
This two are among my top 10 favourite actors.
"As for the actual movie, i would totally recommend it."
"The main story is great with some cool role-plays from "" the old man ""."
"I don't want to make any spoilers, because i hate when people do this to me, so i just invite you to watch it for yourself."
"It has around 1 hour and a half, but you never get bored."
I did watch it with very much interest and it had quite a handful of funny moments.
"One thing i noticed though, or maybe failed to notice."
"In the trailer there is a moment where the 4 co-workers talk at a drink and Jules start saying some comparison about the boys from "" now and then "" thing which in the actual movie i did not see."
Overall a brilliant film.

Different.
Happy Ending.
Slow Paced.
It is a good movie to watch after a dull day.
Little slow in story narration and a bit predictable.
Has a modern touch to it.
Anna Hathway is a wonderful actress as proved in the movie.
"Amazing movie The movie is truly awesome and didn't I forget to say that you are never wrong to do the right thing, may be I was third one to say this after mark twain and Robert De Niro (Ben Whittaker)."
"Old is gold, the movie proves this statement."
"And for women, I heard who sleep less than seven hours a night gain 38% more weight than women who sleeps more than seven hours a night."
Anne Hathway is way too good with her acting and her charm obviously.
I seriously started carrying handkerchief.
There were some real great laugh out loud moments.
"I personally recommend this movie to everyone, guys watch it."
Its a good movie after all.
"And at last, the experience never gets old."
The intern rules the roost An honest submission before i continue.
"Robert De Niro has matured and excelled like anything and like an aging wine, only to taste better."
"The plot is topical ,part funny,part serious and plausible.An aging retired single widower Ben Whitaker played superbly by De Niro yearns for some change and excitement joins a e commerce site as an intern headed by a workaholic adrenaline plenty Anne Hathaway."
She to begin with is not comfortable with the idea of having an aging intern on her side.
However like the proverbial turtle slowly and steadily he manages to win her and everyone's confidence in the office.
Intertwined in the drama is her not so happy marriage which she desperately wants to save.
Obviously in the end not only the intern gets what he wants but also in the process instills life and soul in her boss and the end is a happy mushy affair.
What really works is the depth of this simple plot.The countenance and mannerisms of De Niro are smooth and superbly played by him.He looks neat and crisp in his formal suits.
Anne Hathaway plays her part well though her histrionics towards the end the end to get a bit overboard.
All in all a good watch.
"Breaking the glass ceiling After being recommended this film by a friend, my initial thoughts were that its going to be like 'The Internship' (2013) staring Vince Vaughn."
"Having not watched the trailer or heard much about The Interns release, I was committing myself to watching it with only the knowledge that its about an intern who looks old enough to be my granddad."
"But WOW, what a fantastic film."
You instantly begin to form a bond with Ben (Robert De Niro) which seems to only get stronger as the film progresses.
"A character who's portrayed as a laid back chilled out sort of guy is an instant hit with the whole team, from fellow interns, experienced colleagues and even the CEO."
"Because of this, it makes the movie a very feel good one, one which is able to cheer you up irrespective of your mood."
"Another element of the plot that I particularly enjoyed was the fact that it shows the audience that a woman is able to run a successful business, especially in the 21st century."
"With the old stigma surrounding businesses that experience white men must be in charge, it was nice to see the film overcoming this taboo."
"Not only that but in my opinion it also shows the older generation that their skills and experience can be put to good use even after retirement, e.g."
just because they are not 'tech-savvy' doesn't mean they can't learn.
"Their are also elements of the film that touch on issues more personal to home such as affairs, divorce, parenting etc."
"Although these don't make up the full story, its good to see the movie actively tries to portray them as realistic as possible allowing the audience to relate to similar situations that might have affected their lives."
"Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the film."
"It followed a well written story line along with doing a fantastic job of informing views about what life can be like depending on your gender, age, career, to name but a few."
"Finally, by having two leading actors, from two different backgrounds, being able to support each other in the way they did, really beings home the message that if you put your mind to something and work hard at it then you can achieve it."
Great Robert De Niro was awesome here.
He was cute old man.
Totally different role.
Al in all movie was god.
"Good idea, good execution."
"Light, touching and sweet I became interested in this film primarily because of the light atmosphere represented in trailer."
And the duo of Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro seemed promising.
"Well, the director Nancy Meyers did a great work."
"""The Intern"" is a beautiful film with touching story."
"A story from everyday life, taken to screens, with some special elements, making you smile because of sweet situations shown in film."
"A story, that kind of tells you not to give up."
Light humor only fills this perfect picture.
I like good dramas.
"During watching ""The Intern"", it for some reason reminded me of ""The Devil Wears Prada""."
"Maybe it's because the film is based on the environment of the fashion industry, or maybe it's because of Anne Hathaway, or maybe even both."
"But after watching it I can honestly say, that Nancy Meyers's film has something in common with David Frankel's story, only ""The Intern"" is lighter and isn't so severe."
"""The Intern"" is a perfect drama, –∞ film that justified absolutely all expectations."
"A beautifully made story, which I didn't hesitate to give 10/10."
"this movie make me have hope in my life When I watched this movie it made me feel that I want to work every day until my death

Delicately presented.
It started really well and ended not so great but it's worth watching for the first half.
A Perfect Sunday night movie for a positive week.
"I thought this would be a ok'ish film, boy was i surprised."
I loved it so much.
All characters were apt and did their jobs well.
"Only Negative i could think of this whole film is that, the relationship with her mother could have been worked out in the end."
"A thoughtful review of the movie The Intern So, I just got done watching The Intern featuring the ever charming Robert De Niro and exemplary Anne Hathaway."
"Experience and youth have much to share A wonderful movie that will make you smile, laugh, and maybe even cry."
"The entire family can watch this one and enjoy the value that older people can bring to the workplace, even to an Internet start-up."
"All performances were just about perfect, and Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro are both charming."
"Several themes interplay off each other; older people in a new tech workplace, working mothers trying to balance family, marriage and a career, and stay-at-home fathers; as well as perceptions of older people."
Robert's character and several others in the movie put those stereotypes to the test.
"Finally, a well-made movie with a relevant story for our age that contains no violence or crude behavior."
It's a fun and enjoyable movie to watch that it long overdue in the making.
Feels like we need to put seniors interns in every company to put our busy days and pressures straight upon!
"Great Movie I'll be honest, First time I have watched this movie because of these two great actors and then I have realized they all are great."
Everyone.
And then next day I have watched again.
I always said that a great movie makes you thinking.
This is a great one.
"The kind of movie you will remember forever and you will keep returning to it, to watch it again and again."
This reminded me that every generation does have something good we need to remember.
"I just feel sad now, because I have to watch again so many bad movies until another great one is made."
"I won't say more because now I realize everything is so complicated about this movie, it's an entire universe in it, I would need to write a book and that's not possible."
Does anyone know the feeling of getting quality instead of shallow?
This is quality!
It's rewarding.
"If you're looking for an easy watching and sincere movie 'The Intern' is a comedy/drama movie, which was directed by Nancy Meyers in 2015."
"The movie takes place in Brooklyn, New-York."
"The first thing, which attracted me, was the cast - Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro as the main characters."
"This duo seemed to me quite curious, so I wanted to find out what the plot is."
Another reason why I decided to watch it was the place.
"A lot of movies and series are made in New-York, and I like when a movie contains breathtaking views of this city."
"As for me, it makes movies truly esthetic."
"The Intern' is a story about Ben Wittaker (Robert De Niro), who is 70 years-old."
"He has a family (son and grandchildren), which live quite far from him, and he's a widower."
He has plenty of time and desire to do something new.
Ben finds a vacancy in online-store of women's clothes.
"There he becomes an intern, and his duty is to help Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), a young woman who runs this business."
"I think, the most fascinating thing about the plot is relationship between Jules and Ben."
"She's young and not experienced, he's wise and he has rich background in business."
"No matter, they have a huge age gap, they become good friends."
"Ben supports Jules, not only when it's about work, but in her private life."
"Jules's family is about to fall apart, and she thinks, if she hires a new director, her family will be fine again."
"It's a choice between her work, which is extremely important for her, and her family."
What should she do?
Can this decision save her relationship with her husband?
"It's a tough decision, but with Ben's help she makes a right one."
Experience never gets old'.
This is the general idea of the movie.
"I guess, it means that experience's always needed, it's always modern and it's always useful, no matter, what sort of experience it is."
I love this idea and this movie in a whole.
It's so kind and also dramatic.
"Acting makes you laugh, cry and then laugh again."
"Especially the very last scene makes you feel so calm and peaceful, and that'll be your emotions after watching the whole movie."
"I've seen 'The Intern' about 6 times, and every time characters make me relive these feelings."
"I think, if you want to watch something easy, warm and heartfelt, you should certainly watch this movie."
One of my favorite movies this last year was Nancy Meyers' The Intern.
They're not considering that for the Oscars even though I think Robert De Niro gave one of the best performances this year in that movie.
"I thought the script was actually one of her best', said Quentin Tarantino and added that it's Oscar-worthy."
Intern Nice light movie to watch on sunday afternoon.
Something different.
"Pefect film Love the story line in this and there is some funny moments and sad it's a film for everyone

"Watch if you are having a bad day, will definitely make it better!"
"I was just delighted by the way De Niro and Anne connected in this film, at first i was not really motivated to watch this film but i was missing out on a heartwarming and sweet experience, this movie just makes you feel good after watching, definitely worth checking out!"
Simply wow.
"Touching, soulful There are few movies that simply move you, touch you."
This is one.
Simply amazing.
Fantastic Heartwarming Performance This is the first time I've ever taken the time to write out a review for a movie after renting it.
"The Intern really deserves a 10/10 rating, Robert De Niro, and Anne Hathaway play fantastic characters, with De Niro's performance as a elderly retired gentleman being heart warming and Hathaway's performance being quite balancing and nice."
The movie provided quality character development and provided a nice reprieve to the outside world.
Absolutely a definite watch!
A heartwarming one One of the best movies that I got to see in a long time.
It just made my day or I might saw it made my week.
It gives such postive vibes.
In your real lyf everything might not end up on such a good note always but the movie can certainly pump you up if you are hitting some low days.
"A must watch for anyone who loves smooth running, nerve cooling afternoons."
So much love and warm The movie is just amazing.
It had a kind of vive like the August rush movie.
Watching during such a crazy year put an extra cream over the top.
"Just Wow What a sweet and pure story, really loved it."
I really connected with the actors.
Mesmerizing Some sweet lessons have been taught.
This generation need to hear all of these .
"This movie is perfectly fine It flowed like a river that has few curves and by borrowing the phrase from this movie where Anne Hathaway was commenting on Robert De Niro, saying ""uncanny""."
This movie shows the imperfections of human in every corner where Ben kinda perplexed between two women at the beginning and Jules got confused with her purpose of life (running a business) when she found her husband's affair.
"The atmosphere of this movie wasn't that exiting nor breathtaking but the dramatic sides of it covered everything, enough to end with a rightful happy ending."
"An interesting and cute movie for relaxation and positive emotions ""The Intern"" is an interesting and cute comedy movie."
It identifies at least two problems of social inequality in the modern world - inequality of young and old people in employment and gender inequality.
"The movie tells the story of a pensioner who, after the death of his wife, does not want to live to retire, but wants to work."
"Using the example of the protagonist, it is shown that there are provided equal opportunities for people of any age - he gets a job as an intern in a developing online clothing store."
"After a short time, having adapted his many years of experience in a newspaper factory to modern requirements, he becomes an assistant to the owner of the company, a young woman."
The company is developing rapidly and has many orders and it's ruled by young woman.
"The movie emphasizes that she has a family, that she is not an arrogant person, and that she doesn't live on the dole."
"All this suggests that any woman can work hard and support a family, that everyone has equal opportunities, regardless of gender."
"Separately, it should be noted that in the movie, the heroine's husband is sitting with the child, which also emphasizes equality in determining roles in the family."
"Finally, it should be taken into account the movie, in pursuit of a happy ideal world of equality, skips an important, in my opinion, detail - it practically does not show how ""the intern"" misses his wife."
"On the one hand, it means that anyone can always start life from scratch, regardless of age."
"On the other hand, it is a sad element of the movie that was sacrificed to create a positive picture."
"Break the prejudices In a nutshell, often our prejudices lead us to wrong conclusions about people."
This film is excellent evidence of my words.
"We're introduced with a retired man, Ben (played by Robert De Niro), who's not actually lose interest in life, even after becoming a widower."
"In his 70s, he's still smiling every day, open for new activities, making connections with people, staying polite and conservative."
"One day, Ben seizes the senior fellowship opportunity in trendy fashion agency."
"He's sure that this's exactly what he needs: creative atmosphere, challenging tasks, ability to help others."
But he's facing with prejudice from the side of colleagues.
"Nobody expects from old guy any awareness about clothes industry, nobody wants to spend their time with boring retirees."
"This is tough obstacle, but not for Ben."
He understands such the common beliefs and just tries to help the firm doing his best.
"Ben, ex VP of phone book printing agency, has a great experience in business, and all his efforts happens to be extremely valuable in the fashion office, where everybody is in a hurry."
Ben easily makes a rounds with his new co-workers and show his sensitivity and desire to cooperate with anybody who needs the help.
"So, main character refuted all the claims against old people's inability."
"Personally, film is impressed me."
I've already forgotten when I last time have seen such a kind and genuine movie.
"""The Intern"" teaches us a lot: about good affairs with people, positive attitude to yourself, fairness, honesty, openness and full house of other things that we should never forget in our lives."
"Probably, one of the most important takeaways from this film that person's true essence is inside and for that reason we could be dead wrong with our prejudice."
Funny and touching movie How great it is to watch a movie about a second life in retirement!
Certainly the movie not one person has improved the mood and proved that life doesn't end with reaching retirement age!
"A story unlikely, but it's nice to watch a movie about motivation, action, making changes in your life for the better."
Added to this is the thread of the tightening relationship between the main characters (between the intern and the boss).
You can see how Jules's approach to people changes under the influence of contact with Ben.
I highly recommend this movie for long fall and winter evenings!
"Great and inspiring film Film ""The Intern"" is a great example of strong and impressive humans' lives regardless of age and gender."
"To start with, this story is about the old widower Ben, who has tried everything in his life, but being an intern is a novel experience for him."
"It is surprising, but he immediately becomes a personal intern of the boss (Jules), that is a young and very powerful woman, even somebody tell him: ""Hang in there."
""", but in response, Ben only smiles."
"Their relations with the boss are not good, he was deprived of Jules' attention, may be because she mistakenly think, that elder cannot help her."
"Nevertheless, their story begins, when Ben perfectly deals with a problem of Jules' drunk driver."
"Here viewer shakes hands with scenarist on the fact that only internal qualities of people matter, not age, not gender, not religion..."
"It is very surprising, but ambitious woman and experienced elder become best friends."
"Ben was the man, who rescued Jules' life from two very dangerous decisions, so sometimes very unexpected things (such as an internship for elder) gives the opportunities, one has never dreamed of."
"Jules is sometimes unhappy, her staff is offering a new CEO for her company (to replace her), moreover her husband has an affair."
"Ben helped her to recover from adversity, to save her position and family."
"It is very nice of him to offer a possibility of being buried together, as there is a lot of place near his wife's grave."
But fortunately it is not necessary in the end of film.
Am I the only one?
I tried to watch this but Robert De Niro makes me sick nowadays.
"De Niro wonderful, but film is meh Robert de Niro as Ben the intern is wonderful."
It's heartwarming and nice to see an elderly person get a new lease on life as an intern.
"Also, his relationship with Jules is sweet and comforting."
But the plot of the film is lacking.
It feels like the only purpose of the film was to observe a sweet old man.
Which is nice.
But lacking still.
Also some of the lines are not it.
Lots of strange mini plots...Jules rides a bike around the office 'dude'.
Jules is told to get a ceo.
Jules doesn't like her mother.
"Jules conducts a heist of her mothers house, followed by celebratory shots at the bar where Jules talks of how men are lost in society."
"Then Jules' husband has an affair, whilst her daughter has friendship problems."
And the younger intern who lives with Ben.
It's just a bit random and mismatched.
"The main consistency is the sweetness of Ben, and his relationships and influence on people."
It's a nice film.
But lacks something.
Could've been done better.
"I think the moral of the story, that life can be lived at any age, is good."
But the plot around that was weak.
"Vers good I like this movie, I think the two main character was playing very good."
It's a kind movie!
Wonderful thought provoking movie I have been reliving some of the scenes since I watched it yesterday.
It brought tears many times.
"What a wonderful movie that points to some of the issues of growing old and wanting to still be useful and productive Now I am looking for more of Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway movies

"Amazing to see something like this In the era of avengers and other super hero movies its very rare to find a gem like this which talks about real problems

What a surprising stunnner.
"Wow.This movie was wonderful.Simple yet empowering and shows that you really can accomplish anything in life no matter how old or young you are.The story just grips you in right from the start until the end.Check it out , hopefully you'd also want it to not end as much as I did."
Good Film Very nice movie.
Good actors and Storyline.
Bla bla bla bla.
Really not my genre... until I watched it.
"Not an action movie, not a full blown comedy, not a drooling romance, a drama or a thriller.... and it's not trying to be."
Had a couple of hours to kill and saw this on Netflix.
So thoroughly entertaining that its flaws meant nothing.
Is it a classic that will be remembered and studied for years?
Absolutely not.
Is it a movie that entertained me to the point that I'm so glad I watched?
Absolutely yes.
A simple yet beautiful story about an old intern - not something that is normally thought!
This movie will not stress you out by some dramatic details.
"Otherwise, it brings smile to your face with touching moments."
Contemporary women Jules Ostin has worked as an Intern over a year.
"Moreover she feels guilty about her children and her husband,she pays great attention to her work and focused on her work,she always full of energy and she has pumped up for her job."
In conclusion she didn't give up her job in the end and lived well with her husband.
I recommend this movie for viewing I'm surprised the critics gave this movie such a low rating.
Makes me wonder if they even know how to enjoy a good movie.
"So, it's not original, it raises a few questions that we might disagree with or whatever, but this movie made me laugh, then cry, and at the end it left me with a sense of warmth."
I really enjoyed it.
"I used to watch movies based on critics' evaluations, but now I know better."
Amazing This movie was amazing üëè it was so wholesome and there were times I almost cried.
There alot times it made me smile I would love a part 2 of this movie even though it wouldn't happen it was absolutely fun to watch.
"Troubled route with too happy ending The plot has been summarised extensively, so won't do that here."
"First, the older non internet-savvy intern: really, would a 'senior' be so ignorant (it was their generation that invented the internet) and how to join Facebook?"
"The busy neurotic business creator: I had an Editor much like Anne Hathaway's character and so could relate to her as a genuine role, but with the size of her business I'm surprised that she didn't have meetings/conferences with junior management, which surely would have been set up by the time the film plot starts."
"The new girlfriend for the Intern: the featured Imdb reviewer sees the company masseuse Fiona as needing Ben, the intern."
"But it is Ben who is initially turned on by her, which she follows through perhaps realising older people do get more muscular twinges and provides relaxation treatment for him (he does also have an age related heart condition)."
"The house husband seems slightly disparaging about his job caring for Hathaway's daughter having given up his part in the business, and is not surprisingly too tired for intimacy with his wife, a scene nicely played."
I was surprised she didn't engage in sharing the business issues with him as a consequence and so keep him in tow.
"All that being said, it's a pleasant movie and apart from skirting over how the investors in the startup (they seem very remote) want a new ceo to run the operation, I felt the story threads came together nicely at the end."
"Well overall a nice movie, to spin up and just sit back and relax."
The characters are quirky and fun.
Had been on hold for quite a long time but glad I watched it.
Please ignore the rest.
Just well doing the required.
"They just don't dare to say it openly, they wanted to weed out the down revs and reviewers and came up with a new model that does more harm than any good to the site."
They want to reviews to be much more positive since scores are shred on video platform and negative reviews makes them look very bad and makes shareholders unhappy if they see a low score of a movie or series.
P. S. I still cant fathom that I would have had to write out this whole paragraph .
Bruh!!
"Fulfillment originate from ours inner drivers - not the expertise level When I first saw this title and the description, I was a little bit skeptic."
I've had it on my watchlist though I was putting it off for a few weeks.
Finally my curiosity about Robert De Niro performance as a retired 70-year-old widower named Ben won with me and I started watching.
"After first few minutes of the movie, I knew it is about to be a seed for a whole lot of deep thoughts."
I believe that we - people - often strive to fill a hole in our lives without even properly identifying its cause.
"Second minute of the movie hit with a phrase spoken by Ben - ""I realized the key to this whole deal was to keep moving."
"Get up, get out of the house, and go somewhere."
"Anywhere.""."
"Before I've heard it from De Niro, I couldn't convince myself to believe in this thought, especially the last part, which states that going anywhere is sufficient."
"I didn't agree with it instantly, but for me, the whole movie was a beautiful journey to understanding these words."
"Anna Hathaway played a crucial role in it, because I am not gonna lie - she seduced me as Jules Ostin, workaholic who happens to be a founder of a company, Ben's boss, but first of all - emotional human being trying her best to achieve happiness."
"The story of Jules shows that happiness doesn't come from aligning with others, making sacrifices and hiding things from too observant people."
On the contrary - its root are in the openness.
It is also not required to be an irreplaceable expert to feel fulfillment.
It is entirely sufficient to be an intern.
"It is all about to what environment we bring unique value of ourselves and how we, and our surroundings, perceive it."
A Charm that falls short The Intern had been on my list for a while.
"Advertised as a feel-good movie, it appeared to fit the role of the movie charm you play in the background of your living room once every few weeks such as Serendipity or You've Got Mail."
It almost hit that mark.
I say almost because the concept and motive was there but the script and the character development just fell short.
"The Intern tried to fit the category of an authentic, uplifting, movie but never trusted its audience to carry it to that destination."
Every interaction or relationship just felt superficial or forced.
Scenes between characters provided so much dialogue and direction that nothing ever evolved organically.
"The script almost felt like it was scared of empty spaces between scenes, scared of body language or silence communicating the message in its own way."
"Instead, these moments were filled with bland dialogue that never let the scene reach its true feel-good potential."
There is a similar scenario with the relationships between characters in this film.
"Some were started but never revisited, others were started and completed offscreen without the audience taking the journey with the characters."
They just became more missed opportunities.
The blueprints for The Intern were there but were not executed to its truly great potential.
"Having said that, there are still great takeaway moments, and it is not a total failure, just something that could have been much more."
It will make you relax...
"I loved it guys the acting, emotions and the story are amazing and make you feel peace."
The acting of Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway are sensational and fulfilling.
I would recommend this movie to all stressed out people and I am sure they will find some peace and smile after watching it.
What makes this movie so special?
I will say the flow of the movie makes special.
The total cast deserves appreciation for it.
"Secondly, there is no noisy or irritating action, sex, violence or CG which you will see in most of the movies released in the past decade."
You won't get bored even for a second.
Seriously I got really irritated when something or someone disturb me while watching it.
Because I was totally in to that movie and It happens very rare.
So what you are waiting for?
go for it and watch it.
A twist of fun and happiness.
"First let me mention that this is my first review ever i give to a movie only because it's ""unusual"" these days to find a movie like this.I was so impressed that i decided to ""promote"" this kind of material so in the future all the ""garbage"" will be where it's supposed to be."
This is how modern films should be written .
"It is fun , amusing and most importantly it teaches you the ""value"" of a handkerchief."
All the actors were exquisite and i would recommend this film to every person i know.
You should watch this regardless of your genre preferences.
Overall it was a very pleasant experience and it is the first time in a very long time when i get out of the room with a smile on my face.
"We are the intern All people may not agree with me for this rating but believe me, this movie brings out colors which we miss in our robotic life.It might have been said in 20 minutes as a short film but the real positive of this movie is its run time which allows you to get involved with characters and situations.There might have been some characters and scenes which could be unrealistic(breaking into house scene) which may bring u back that, we are watching just a movie.Movie will be good to u if u don't have any expectation and just want a movie to pass your time in late night.Teenagers may have slept don't bother waking them up.May be it would be remade by the time they can realize it that it was wonderful"
A Simple Feel Good Movie....
It's a movie which will always cheer you up.
The main thing I love about this movie is the simplicity of its story-line.
Also the soundtrack is great.
Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro gave a really good performance.
I've always loved both their works and now this one too.
Feelgood movie :) Saw the trailer a while ago and already then was looking forward for the movie.
Seeing De Niro i a comedy is always fun.
The real Action/gangster doing a roll like this.
Just shows what an amazing actor he is.
From the first start of the movie a big smile on my face.
"Great actors, comedy and drama."
The feeling De Niro's character brings happiness to others not just by what hes doing but also by just being the way he is.
This is by far one of my favorite movies of 2015.
A great movie.
Very Nice Movie When you watch this movie you will be happy immediately.
"Nice and lovely performance from the big star ""Robert De Niro""."
"I love ""Anne Hathaway"" Smile so much she is so brilliant."
"Performance more than wonderful, especially that between the two holders of the Oscars It's Really very good light comedy movie."
"""Rene Russo"" shiny and bright in this age, she is really wonderful woman A story is Simple, the decoration of the company so beautiful."
"and finally I laughed a lot from the comedy performance of ""Andrew Rannells""."
"This Movie changed my mood and inspired me to try to start my own business, Simply I loved Every thing in this light movie."
One of those movies you can watch over and over!
"Clever, smart and original movie!"
My sons from teens to 20's and my husband and I all love it!
Good up until the end Good clean humor.
Completely different role for De Niro.
Hathaway and De Niro make an interesting match for this movie.
It was fun to watch.
Didn't like the casting for Hathaway's husband.
He didn't seem to be a good match for her character role.
Everything was great up until the end.
It was too cheesy and the husband's acting was just too fluffy.
It made me rate it at a 5 and want to write my first movie review as a disappointment.
And the ending was poorly written and executed.
I recommend watching if in the mood for a light comedy but expect to be disappointed at the end.
I'll be mad about this till I watch a new movie.

Great Movie It is an excellent movie.
It has a very soft humor.
I loved how Ben try to learn about the new model of companies.
"Robert and Anne had a great chemistry, they were very fun together."
"I love Robert De Niro's Comedy Movies, his gangster expressions are always hilarious."
"I prefer see Anne in Comedies, they performances are much better

The movie are going to catch you all the time, it has a great argument."
The only thing I did not like it was the end.
It didn't have any sense.
But I don't care.
It was great and fun.
I recommend you to see it.
"What a friendly movie This was such a friendly, light - hearted movie!"
"Really enjoyed it from start to finish, and the plot was gripping enough."
"It goes beyond saying, Hathaway and De Niro both excell as an acting couple, she is one of the great performers of our time and he, well you know who he is."
At first you might think of it in a Nabokov - style but it just does not play that way at all.
It is more a tale of classicism vs. contemporary and it works!
Maybe a little unoriginal but the movie is a breath of fresh air to De Niro's filmography.
"Lately, his movies kind of lack of himself, and he lost the stigma he had about cinema back when he shot Meet the Fockers."
You can tell how excited he is for being there and that is just beautiful.
"Anyone can enjoy this movie, and appreciate the above average camera work, and even some symmetry clammed in as well."
"Again, De Niro delivers a role that goes different from what he has been accustomed to play lately, taking into account that his latest movies involve him in an ""oldie but goodie"" personna (talke Last Vegas and Dirty Grandpa for instance) but he is not the same in each role despite the character his age has him play."
"He radicalizes these roles, and contrasts them so well, despite the quality of thee."
"Really enjoyable movie to relax in the summer, pretty laid back, and it is beautiful to still be able to witness a performance by one of the greatest artist of our generation!"
"Specially paired up with Anne, just works somehow."
"Looking forward to watching this acting relation progress, Scorsese, might want to pay attention."
"Fresh movie, funny and touching at crucial points."
Eight out of ten.
"Purely A Magical Movie Experience never gets old, is an apt brief description of this eventual classic."
"Make sure you ""...carry a handkerchief,"" so that is what they eventually are for."
A near perfect soundtrack in the background subtly helps bring it all together as well.
"It took me weeks to decide to watch it, now I cannot believe that I was afraid to pop the cork!!"
"Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway have such a great chemistry together as eventual ""Padawan"" and ""Life's Mentor""."
"They don't just go through the motions, they both bring great acting chops to their roles, with even a laugh or three."
It began to grow on me about 80 minutes in.
It starts out slightly slow but ages into a fine wine by the conclusion.
Don't hesitate to let it age on you!
The special bonding between a young lady & a (grand) father - figure.
"While watching Nancy Meyer's 'The Holiday', it occured to me that the story of the special bonding between Kate Winslet & Eli Wallach is the most endearing sub-plot of the movie."
"In 'The Intern', this special bonding has been amplified & augmented nicely."
"Anne Hathaway is vibrant & successful but could do with a bit of (grand) fatherly attention & care (something that she may have missed in her childhood, having a mother with a strong personality)."
"The trust & affection between the two characters, build up naturally & nicely."
"An enjoyable movie, with some pleasant & non contrived lessons about life."
Worth Watching - Entertaining The Intern is an entertaining one.
The plot is unique and interesting.
"The protagonists, Jules and Ben, are very strong characters and are played beautifully by Anna and Robert De Niro, respectively."
Ben despite being from the old generation supports the idea of working woman and is a sorted person who offers helping hand to everybody.
"I learned two things from the movie - Keep your energy focused on what matters by keeping the other things simple and ""You're never wrong to do the right thing - Mark Twain""."
It is worth investing time.
Happy Watching!
"Just perfect Amazing movie, perfect story and very close to what we are living nowadays!"
"Everything you want and more, even SF :-) Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway waltzing in a tear-squeezing life- teaching comedy?"
"Well, they've done it!"
And they've done it with class.
"You shouldn't miss this movie, no matter what age, sex, religion, preference."
"Did I say ""sex""?"
"Oh, well."
This movie is also a bit of sci-fi.
"Actually more ""fi"" than ""sci"", because, let's be clear on a detail... to have a Anne Hathaway wife jumping at you in bed - and you to turn your back to her ?"
"What molecule, forget a human being, on this earth could say ""no"" to Anne - in bed?"
Eh?
Not even C-3PO could!
"Anyway, go watch the movie, laugh, cry and get wiser!"
"The Life of an Executive Women Although Ben Whittaker (De Niro), the intern, is the central character of this movie, as a female manager and titled officer of a multi-billion international corporation, I easily identified with the Jules Ostin (Hathaway) the company founder."
"Like her, I face the same challenges in a high pressure job."
How she tries so hard to make everyone happy to the point of sacrificing her own happiness.
"Of particular note, is how her own gender slanders Jules with disparaging remarks while conversing with Ben."
These selfish women relish in humiliating and belittling Jules in ways that make her question her womanhood.
"To say this movie is ""cute"" is like saying ""oh that's nice"" to a soldier who just returned from front-line battle in Afghanistan."
"The point is, even when a woman is the founder of a company, the ""glass ceiling"" is still there unless she gets the support she deserves and needs in her professional and personal life."
I loved this movie and would highly recommend it to men and women of all ages.
A 70 years old man got an internship in an online company.
But who will gain experience?
The intern or the company?
The Intern is a story of retired old man 'Ben'(Robert De Niro) who got internship in a online clothing company ran by 'Jules'(Anne Hathway) and how her life changes when Ben become part of her life.
The plot is polite and lovable.
It mainly revolve around Ben and Jules.
Great work has been done by Robert De Niro and Anne Hathway.
Love the background score by Theodore Shapiro.
Small comedy scenes really helped in holding the plot for a while.
While some didn't.
But the story is so simply lined that you will feel very relaxed watching it and also you will enjoy the work of De Niro.
"So, If you are looking for a calm and lovable movie and of course if you are a fan of De Niro and Anne Hathway, you should definitely watch this movie."

"Another Would-Be Hollywood Drama/Comedy With a well-known and Academy Award winning cast, a relatively unique concept, and potential for several social statements (particularly gender and age), the film could have been a heart- warming, thought-provoking drama, but was suppressed mainly due to a seemingly rushed and plot-less screenplay."
"The ""story"" (or rather a glimpse of some character's lives) followed Ben (Robert De Niro), a 70-year-old widower, hired as an intern for a fashion site run by a frantic and busy woman, Jules (Anne Hathaway), dealing with business problems as well as relationship problems."
"Throughout the film, Jules is confronted with problems that challenge her role as a mother and a leader of a company, all of which Ben observes and assists in whichever way he can."
"In reality, the plot has no real structure; it has a beginning: Ben is hired, but the middle appeared to consist of minimal conflicts, and the end was as satisfying as, well, most movies nowadays."
"One of the more painful results of the story was the emerging of rather important issues of our time (the role of woman in our society, as well as that of the elderly) but completely obliterating the possible emotional impact by having the characters admit their stances (have we never heard of ""show don't tell""?)."
"The acting itself was not unexpected: several scenes of Hathaway sobbing and De Niro's humble old-man expressions, all of which were good, however concealed with the atrocious storytelling of the writer/director who preferred prettiness over content."
Heart touching Very simple plot but very hear touching.
The chemistry of both the characters is wonderful.
Idea of seniors interns is imaging.
A blend of fast pace internet business and it challenges give a good touch.
Really loved this movie.
"violation of massage therapy ethics I enjoyed the movie except for the part where the company-contracted ""masseuse"" (just hold up right there, that term is so antiquated!)"
"gratuitously comes on to the main character while giving him a 'chair massage', fondling around his love handles inappropriately, whereupon he is depicted as becoming aroused."
This is a violation of any Massage Ethics course #080 in the country.
"Of course, the scene is depicted as quirky fun."
"Oh, yes, then they begin to 'date', another blatant violation of massage ethics."
"I could have given it 8 stars maybe, for it's commentary on urban, comfort-class social quandaries around gender and age."
But sorry no.
"Become aware, people, please, do we need to be continuing to snicker at the massage profession?"
Can we grow up now?
"Time well spent When I saw the reviews for this movie in the theater, I got the impression that it was going to be a caricature of elderly in the workplace, i.e.forgetful,and disorganized."
But this movie was a pleasant surprise.
Robert DeNiro's character was thoughtful and competent.
He gave it just the right touch.
I also liked Anne Hathaway's character.
She was an owner of a online Amazon-like company.
She seemed too rushed and frazzled.
(Don't know if that is what she was trying to portray or not) and she seemed a little young for her position.
Do CEO's ride their bicycles in the warehouse ?
That seemed a little silly.
And her employees seemed fresh out of college (or high school) and acted it.
"Not much of a plot but.was fairly easy to follow, but there were characters that seemed to be thrown in as fillers."
The chauffeur was on screen not over a minute.
Thankfully no nude scenes or profanity.
"It was the best ""feel good"" movie I have seen in a while."
"Entrepreneur and Mentor Wonderful and inspirational movie, for each entrepreneur about the importance of a having a mentor, even if by chance."
"Explains how investors are interested in the founder success, and how they care about their money and they may recommend to select another CEO normally."
"and most importantly you are what to start a business trip as a startup, you need to be understand the smallest details of your project."
De Niro as usual perform as brilliant as usual.
"Hathaway still ambitious from The Devil Wears Prada :)

"No bad - but mini-vomit included The Intern was not such a bad movie - alone the depicted ridiculous leftist ""modern softie"" role-model of men is deplorable, humiliating and unbearable."
I had to hit my wife around the house a bit after watching so I got reassurance I am still a man :P That was a joke of course but the nucleus of my criticism is appropriate and concise from an objective point of view.
De Niro and Hathaway play their roles as good as they can be played considering the setting and characters.
Hathaway's husband is not only ugly and leagues under her - he is also the witchking of the above mentioned manly role-narrative.
The detailed business-conduct differences between the old-school business-type of Robert de Niro and the modern Internet-age online-shop business-type embodied by Anne Hathaway was quite lucid and nice but does also not heave the movie into a higher movie-experience.
A Gem of a Movie!
Watching this movie was a roller coaster of emotions and lessons in life.
"The movie was a full package of themes surrounding friendship, loyalty, chivalry, marriage, family, sacrifice, life, preserving novelty yet embracing change all together, going for your dreams, getting to know yourself, peace with oneself, and most of all courage, among anything else."
"This movie made me cry and dwell deeper and look at my 30-something life thru the eyes of a career-driven, millennial like Jules (Anne Hathaway); yet it also made me ponder on what lies ahead and what I would ever want to achieve thru Ben's life (Robert Deniro."
A brilliant Gem of a movie!
I specially suggest all millennials watch this!

"Very, very good, EXCEPT...."
The movie was excellent and very moving in many ways EXCEPT...
SPOILER: the movie implies that somehow human forgiveness alone and/or human hope through some sort of philosophic adherence to humanistic philosophy and possible adherence to Eastern Religious Mysticism's Tai Chi practice might be some sort of effective unifying solution for their problems that will somehow bring true healing and wholeness in the end.
Reconciliation at the end of the movie without any of the characters ever coming to a genuine knowledge that the only true hope of forgiveness and healing is available through trusting in the Lord Jesus and His sacrifice on the cross for their personal sins alone as their ONLY hope.
"Otherwise this movie should generally only be recommended for those who already really know the biblical truth of what's really going on in this universe otherwise, unfortunately, only a false and deceptive humanistic solution is offered at the end of it all."
A Well Made Movie the movie was so cheerful and romantically attached one.it had a good pace from starting to end.it was very long after i have seen Robert-DE Niro movie.
i have to accept that it was one of best roles i liked.for Anna Hathway also this was best performances after devil in Parda.
the relationship between both have been shot very carefully and also some humor in it.only breaking the house was little more to swallow.But in some point of view that seen is also OK. you will enjoy the movie throughly.
you cannot see much movie well made like this because now a days movies are made from ugly comedy and romance.
"the director show how a romantic comedy movie should be made

Beautiful and joyous movie Beautiful movie that has covered so many aspects of our everyday life!
I have actually understood that you have to choose which movie to watch by choosing your favorite producer.
I have found my first best producer.
Nancy Meyers is a perfect fit in her life for being such talented producer!
All of her movies are the ones that you'd watch more than once and would want to share with your friends and loved ones.
Not bad but had so much potential I'm pretty ambiguous about this movie.
"I really liked the way Robert De Niro played the elderly Ben who is trying to find his way back into life with a senior internship with to successful e-commerce entrepreneur Jules, played by Anne Hathaway."
The way they're relationship as friends grows in a wonderful way.
Even though I really enjoyed most of the movie but I found quite a few parts really disappointing.
While I'm okay with this movie being extremely PC I think they really missed pointing out the downsides of the displayed lifestyle.
They did portray a few problems but in the end everything seems to fall back into place without any suffering or any real compromises.
Everything is just awesome for Jules and everyone supports her regardless of the mistakes she made before (and at no point really stopped making).
The movie kind of ends just where it started which was really unsatisfying for my.
All in all I liked the characters but think that the storyline had much unused potential.
Intern!
I recently rented the Intern from on demand at home!
"I thought it was a great movie, with amazing actors, and a classic story about Internet start-ups."
It shows the struggles that Jules Ostin (Ann Hathaway) has with running and being the CEO of her own company.
"With the help of Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) her 70-year-old intern, she is able to get her home life back together and make important business decisions on where to bring her company next."
The movie is perfect examples of how different the generations are and how technology has changed basically everything.
Robert De Niro and Ann Hathaway both do such a good job in this movie and bring a wonderful chemistry as well.
I would defiantly recommend seeing this to anyone especially those wanting to do start a start up business.
"offensive The references to bipolar disorder in this movie, equating this devastating and potentially fatal illness, to a 4 year old's temper tantrum is at the height of insensitivity and cruelty."
The scene I am referring to is the one where the dad is talking to his 4 year old daughter about her moody little friend.
"He says ""sounds like she is bipolar"" with a little smirk on his face."
Later in the movie he and his daughter are at the playground.
"They see this little friend, she scowls and hides behind her mother."
"He and his daughter look at each other and smile, ""Yep, bipolar""."
I have bipolar 1 disorder with psychotic symptoms.
I have attempted suicide once and been hospitalized three times.
I will need to take medicine for the rest of my life.
"I daily face the possibility that I may develop a condition called tardive dyskenesia, a permanent condition that resembles Parkinson's disease, as a result of one of the mood stabilizers I must take to be able to function."
That ignorance like this still exists in mainstream media amazes me.
Miss Meyers needs to spend some time serving patients in psychiatric ward to treat her own lack of compassion and ignorance.
I will never watch one of miss Meyers' movies again.
It is a shame that those of us suffering with diseases of the brain cannot sit down with our families and watch a seemingly harmless movie without worrying about being emotionally assaulted.
Do not see this movie and participate in stigmatizing and cruel attempts at entertainment.
If I could permanently remove this movie from public consumption I would.
It is poison.
Sweet and Heart Warming I thoroughly enjoyed this movie with my family.
I found the characters cute and quirky and enjoyed it from the beginning through the end.
The movie kept me interested in the characters and what was going on in each scene relating to the stories delivered.
The movie does It job in delivering characters and story lines which keeps you interested and wanting more.
Robert plays his role perfectly and I couldn't help liking and wanting the best for his and Anne's characters.
"To me, The Intern is one of those movies that you are disappointed when it ends because you want to spend more time enjoying the characters."
Robert and Anne delivered their performances very well.
"The movie brought me laughter, dismay, intrigue, and tears."
"I recommend this movie to those who like quirky, cute movies, with dashes of seriousness."
"Deep breath of ""humanism"" During this movie and after... You feel how this is important it is to show empathy towards others, to understand their worries, their problems... To be altruist.. And how this positively affects you as an individual."
"Being modest, being a intern, being just yourself, doing your work and again, how this will positively be rewarded The contrast between the ""old school"" way of doing business and the start-ups state of mind is another important piece in this movie as it shows that both can coexist and create a beautiful melting pot."
"The performance of De Niro is just awesome, he is actually a great actor, the disconnection between the previous roles (gansters, mafioso, and others...) and the drama roles he plays the last couple of years is just impressive."
"Thanks for this lesson of humanism

Real Movie to make your good day What I'm going to say is It's a really good movie!
I really love it.
Love the actors.
Love every scenes of it.
Love the story.
The issue which tells us about feminism were packed in a good way.
No one's hurt by this movie.
"The happy- ending also packed in some kind of ""balance"" by showing some TaiChi moves at the end of it."
"The movie also tells us about people with high level integrity and work-ethics in their workplace, something almost extinct nowadays."
"Anne Hathaway always be the perfect-suit to play this kind of role, as she did in Devils Wears Prada."
What I'm little bit surprising was the warm-uncle-look role played by Robert De Niro as I only noticed most of his role are as Mafia or someones who commit criminal.
"Something different than usual Amazing, unpredictable and definitely unusual movie."
Recommend this to everybody.
While watching this film I had very different emotions and feelings.
"In this movie you can cry a little bit, you can laugh a little bit."
Also the film was very enjoyable because how I said earlier it was unusual.
It wasn't the same plot that we all know and have seen before.
"It is hard to say what is so special about this movie, but there definitely is something."
For example after the story you realize how different and unusual events could happen in your life.
We understand that it's never too late to make big decisions.
Because those decisions can lead us to much better life than we have know.
And your ages is not always the biggest problem.
What I want to say is that you just need to enjoy this thrilling and beautiful story!
"different than I expected Maybe it is my fault for not reading enough about it beforehand, but I had the impression that this would be a goofy and lighthearted comedy about the differences in values, practices, language, etc."
between baby boomers and millennials.
"(With actors like Adam Devine and Anders Holm in the cast, can you blame me?"
"Also, I think they wanted to get Blake Anderson as well, but couldn't, so they just put a substitute in there."
"If you see it, you'll know who I mean.)"
"Instead, it's a somewhat sappy (not quite a romantic comedy though) story about the trials of the working professional mother and how wisdom through life experience can be used to improve her life."
The story is not bad.
"There are some cringe worthy references to sexism in business thrown in there, and the working mother gets judged by the stay at home moms (who eventually get called out)."
"However, she is not generally presented as a poor oppressed woman in tech, kept down by the evil Patriarchy."
"Instead, she is presented as someone overwhelmed by her own busy life, but committed to taking responsibility and just needing some guidance."
It's a situation that I think people can relate to.
"Overall, it's a decent date movie with some laughs."
But Workaholics it is not!
Feel good movie I loved this movie and the way that Robert De Niro was represented as the older man.
The arc of transformation from Gangster to Grandad is done well.
The relationship between old and new is brought together to create a movie that makes you smile.
Hathaway has a fabulous on screen persona which works well with De Niro.
At times the movie is comical accompanied by a sentimental narrative which keeps you engaged.
I would recommend this movie as it's a bit of light entertainment that reminds viewers of how gentleman used to be and still are in some cases!
Well worth a viewing.
Good wholesome movie It was nice to watch a nice movie that gave you that warm feeling of happiness that you didnt want to end.
"I thought before u started watching it i knew what i was going to get, but it gave a couple of suprising twists in the story line."
Even i wanted to become friends with the intern in the end and im only 29.
Feel Good Movie I love this movie.
From beginning to the end I never get bored.
A Feel Good and Uplifting Film The Intern is a film which is multifaceted and covers many different topics in a way that is enjoyable and easy to watch.
In this film Ben is used to portray the old man who is out of touch with the modern world.
Jules is used to portray the modern woman who breaks the social norms of the stay-at-home mother to pursue her dreams.
Matt is a depiction of the possible role of the modern day man as a stay-at-home Dad and Jules and Matt's relation is the depiction of a modern relationship.
The film takes you through these characters' lives and how the old can mixed in with the new and can still be relevant in a modern age.
If you're looking for a film that you can analyse and pick apart then this film isn't for you.
"But if you want a film that you can sit down and enjoy with your significant other and not think about too much, then this film should be on your watch list."
"I don't like movies... ...and the reason for that is because I usually find myself feeling disappointed, uninspired, and empty."
I watched the preview for The Intern and couldn't feel LESS motivated to watch a movie which had the potential to be so clich√©d and predictable.
"Old man, young businesswoman, she hates him, then slowly starts to like him, cutesy/special friendship forms, he stays at her company forever and ever and so on..."
But this movie wasn't like that.
It was actually the kind of movie where I was glad I was watching it alone because it had so many simple lovely moments throughout the film that I couldn't stop tearing up.
"I pretty much cried through the whole film (but don't worry, that's just me!)"
"As far as casting goes, I was pretty impressed."
"I initially questioned why De Niro might be appearing in what looked like a ""chick flick"" (totally not a chick flick by the way!)"
"but after I saw it, it made a lot of sense."
"And his performance was, of course, impeccable as ever."
The rest of the cast was great too.
"I also need to acknowledge the writers of the film for taking a risk in respect to the relationship between Hathaway's character and the husband, played by Anders Holm."
"When their circumstances take a difficult and emotional turn, the events that follow are surprising and engaging to say the least."
It's definitely not your standard rom-com and that's what makes this movie so great.
"So, now that it has been about ten minutes since the movie ended and my tears have dried, I can safely say that I loved this film SO much and am glad I took a chance on it."
Yes it was heartwarming and made me feel all fuzzy inside BUT.... there was something realistic and powerful about this movie that you don't come across often.
"The Intern is an amusing movie to watch because it takes common scenarios and puts a twist on it,."
"College and high school students often get internships at companies over the summer to get real, in-the-field work experience."
"Other times, students get internships as something to put on their college applications, giving them an edge over others."
"However, in the movie ""The Intern"" by Nancy Meyer, the new intern at the company is an 70 year old retired man."
"The CEO of this company is a young woman, around age 23, who started the company herself."
She believes that she has to do everything at the company and demands to oversee everything.
The new intern has his internship at an online fashion store company.
"Ben Whittaker, the intern, has no idea how to work a computer."
"He does not have an email, he does not know how to navigate Facebook, much less does he know how to online shop."
"In Nancy Meyer's movie, ""The Intern,"" it takes common scenarios and twists them to go against stereotypes, making the movie amusing to watch."
Ben Whittaker is the 70 year old intern who knows nothing about computers.
"However, he is still successful in the company because of his proper ways."
He teaches the rest of his coworkers the proper mannerisms needed to excel at life and please your boss.
"Despite not knowing anything about the company, he does small things around the office and helps out the CEO, Jules, to make her day a little simpler."
"One morning, Ben gets to work extra early to help Jules clean up an extra messy table so she has one less thing to stress about."
"Ben makes an effort to do all these small things, such as driving her to and from work, which add up to help warm his way into Jules's heart."
"She eventually accepts him and they become very close friends, to the point that she trusts him with her life."
"Ben Whittaker goes against most stereotypes because he is a retired man who knows nothing about computers, however, he is still able to make it in the company."
"Besides Ben, Jules, the boss and starter of the company, also defies stereotypes."
"She has a child, and her husband is a stay at home husband who does all the cooking, cleaning, and other familial stuff."
"On the other hand, Jules is a strong, hard-headed woman who believes in overseeing everything and doing everything to make sure it is done."
"In one clip of the movie featuring the other stay-at-home mothers of the children who go to Jules's daughter's preschool, Ben is talking to the women and the dislike for Jules is obvious, either because they are jealous, or think she does not spend enough time with her child."
"Once again, Jules goes against most stereotypes that a boss should be a firm, Caucasian man with a stay-at-home wife who does the dishes."
"The movie ""The Intern"" is very interesting in the fact that it takes common scenes and adds a tweak to make it go against most stereotypes."
"Watching these different scenes play out also adds a hint of humor into the movie, making it enjoyable to watch."
"Ben Whittaker is a retired worker who knows nothing about this type of work, defying the stereotype that interns are college students looking for a job."
"Continuing to defy clich√©s, the boss of this company is a young woman who has a daughter and stay-at-home husband, going against the stereotype that all CEO's are Caucasian men with trophy wives."
"Because of the twist in scenario, the movie is able to add humor into it, making it amusing to watch."
Positive Too positive and full of energy ))) First ever movie which made me to write a review.
Good work ethics!!
"This is a great movie for the younger generation to learn good work ethics, And the older generation to understand the younger generation!!"
"It was a little slow, but fun to watch!!"
"nice, but not as good as it could have been This movie turned out to be more drama than comedy, which is what I was looking forward to."
"While I don't regret watching it, there was one aspect that made it hard to get through at times: the Matt character (played by Anders Holm)."
Every time there was a scene with him the movie was like a song that suddenly fell flat.
"I figured, ""The people who cast this movie know what they are doing, it must be me,"" so I really tried to appreciate him--to no avail."
"I think his part was both written as two-dimensional and acted flatly, especially in contrast to the effusive and expressive Anne Hathaway, the endearing Robert De Niro, and other surprising performances."
All the other main characters/actors were delightful.
"The movie had some fun scenes, but over all was somewhat slow-moving for this decade."
It could have been pared down.
"Linda Lavin's character, for example, was extraneous."
Neither a bad movie nor a memorable one.
"If you don't have great expectations, you'll probably enjoy this film."
Why you need to carry a handkarchief..!!
"The movie plot was amazingly well scripted, the movie brings out the generation gap and teaches how one with an experienced life adult could help the young ones to inspire."
"The best part was about the handkerchief, where the old guy suggest to the young one to have a handkerchief so when the time is right you could lend a handkerchief to women/girl."
"All the way around ,it was a wonderful movie."

Very sensitive and thought work!
It was amazing to see Robert de Niro in such a likeable role.
The film digs you in from the very start.
its quite inspiring to see how someone can have so much impact on your life.
Almost perfect!
This movie really can relate to everyone in every gender.
"I can get ""knowledges"" from this movie."
"About life, that maybe we cant realize."
"Everything was just precisely, not overwhelmed."
"When the movie was over, it left something sweet in my heart."
"Robert De Niro Proves to be ""The Right Fit"" for The Intern My love for Nancy Meyers films was proved true once again with The Intern."
"With hits like The Holiday, Father of the Bride, and It's Complicated, I was not surprised with the hard work shown throughout The Intern, a comedy-drama film starring Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway."
The storyline of The Intern doesn't feel too predictable and contains enough plot twists along the way to keep you guessing.
"From character shifts to relationship struggles, I couldn't take my eyes off this film."
"On top of the exciting storyline, the direction and setting also add to the film."
"The Intern is about Ben Whittaker, played by Robert De Niro, a retired, widowed, seventy-year-old who worked as an executive for DEX One."
"Ben finds himself bored while living an uneventful, retired life in Brooklyn, New York and after seeing a flyer, he applies and lands a senior intern role for an online fashion website."
"Working completely online is initially a challenge for Ben, someone who worked for a phonebook company for forty years."
The difference in age of Ben and his Co-Interns gives him the opportunity to teach them with his knowledge and experience and they return the favor by teaching him all about Facebook and simple tasks like how to turn on his new work laptop.
"On top of the technology struggles, Ben is placed to work directly alongside the founder of the company Jules Ostin, played by Anne Hathaway."
"From the beginning, Ben is warned this task is going to be a tough one but despite the difficulty of the task, he uses his intellectual wit and charm to impeccably fill the role."
"Robert De Niro never fails to bring laughter to the film as he has done so before in Meet the Parents, Dirty Grandpa, and The Comedian."
"Aside from bringing laughter to the film, De Niro will continue to warm your heart scene after scene as he takes the extra step to help Jules out both in and out of the office."
"Not only does De Niro perfect his role, but Anne Hathaway as Jules Ostin is nothing short of spot on."
"Jules Ostin was a stay at home mom before being inspired to create an online shopping website centered around the difficulty behind finding ""The Right Fit"" in clothing."
Hathaway embodies this role with great passion as she promotes women in the workforce while also standing firm in her role at her company when they are contemplating bringing in an outside CEO.
"Although the film portrays moms in the workforce, like Jules Ostin, as very hardworking, the film also gives off the vibe that working moms are not able to also be good moms."
"This may come off a bit harsh and unappealing to working moms who view this film and I believe that Meyers, a working mother herself, could have done a better job avoiding this."
Each scene of the film has been long thought out and carefully staged and filmed.
"In one particular scene, subjective point of view through the eyes and ears of Jules was used as she observes the objects in bathroom surrounding her."
Following this shot there's a straight cut to Matt in the bedroom on the other side of the door.
The remarkable angles and shots bring a variety of emotions to the viewer without the use of words throughout the entire scene.
The Intern exemplifies the idea over and over again that we all have something to learn from someone else.
"As Jules and Ben continuously learn and grow with each other throughout this film, so will your desire to keep on watching and unveil the outcome of Jules predicaments."
"The Intern Will Get You Excited About Working... That's a First As I begin to think more about my future and career options, I am drawn to Design and Marketing."
"In the movie, The Intern, most of the movie takes place in an office setting."
"This is where the main character, Jules, runs her up and coming business."
The setting is what initially got me excited to watch this movie.
"Even if you aren't all that ecstatic about the business world, i'm sure you will love the movie for all of its other qualities."
"The movie opens with a tilt, down from the trees into a park where we first meet the one of the main characters."
"Ben Whittaker, a seventy-year-old man who is struggling to find meaning in his life."
Ben later comes across a flyer that explains an intern position for senior citizens.
He wastes no time and applies for the job.
"After time goes by we meet the other lead role, Jules Ostin."
She is a powerful business women that is 18 months into starting her own company.
Ben gets one of the intern positions and is assigned to assist Jules with anything she needs.
We soon learn that she is not the easiest person to work for.
She is strong willed and believes she must do everything within the company to make sure it's done right.
Nobody takes the time to get to know her accept for Ben.
Throughout the rest of the movie we see their relationship transform.
"Not only do the characters develop a connection to one another, the audience finds a love for the characters as well."
Robert De Niro does an amazing job playing the role of Ben.
He has been seen in many movies but I have to say that his role in The Intern was very fitting.
Ben's relationship with Jules makes for a heartwarming story with some comedy mixed in.
"The part of Jules has been questioned by some, it is common to feel that her character is putting a poor image on working moms."
"By the end of the film, Jules fixes this stereotype and establishes a better image for working moms."
All around the actors who filled roles in this movie did an outstanding job.
"The connection and bond on and off the set was very clear, everyone casted in this movie worked very well together."
Looking back over some of the movies highlights I found that the movie The Internship is very similar in many ways.
Not just the name but the whole idea and process of the movie.
"They both have interns that are considered ""old"", the use of technology is very big in both, and both movies came out in very similar eras."
With these two movies being so similar people may begin to compare them and rank one lower than the other.
"As The Intern came out 2 years after The Internship, Nancy Meyers ideas may not have been as original."
"Nancy Meyers and the director of The Internship, Shawn Levy, are both successful and have created two very popular films."
"Without giving away any spoilers, there are many surprises that cause the movie to change direction."
These shifts are executed very well through the script as well as the actors cemotion.
Once you fall in love with the characters you feel the pain and struggle they go through.
"Even Though there are many twists that have the audience questioning the future of the characters and the business, the ending leaves you very fulfilled."
So many different aspects of this movie stand out to me as a strength.
"From the brilliant acting, to the great director, and the stunning quality of setting and costume."
This movie is a must see!
There is no doubt in my mind that I will be watching this movie again sometime in the near future.
Overall I would consider the plot and story line of the movie to be one of the best I have seen.
"The popular film director, producer and screenwriter, Nancy Meyers did an amazing job with this movie."
I hope you enjoy The Intern as much as I did.
