Why even such a beautiful and successful woman in American movies has to accept such an ordinary and cheating husband?
"It all depends on De Niro.The first half looked good, the second half values swallowed conservative and retreated.De Niro's people are a little too perfect."
"For me, the world will be a better place if I can make one or two such warm skits every year that look good and release tears.。。。。"
"When Hathaway intervened in Streep's strongwoman life, now De Niro anti-invasion Hathaway life……actually a little ambitious, trying to discuss career women and the older generation, but floating a bit.I like Hathaway a lot, but every little expression of her has a sense of rehearsal and release, especially compared to De Niro's relaxed share.And De Niro is really handsome...…………"
"It's been a long time since I've seen Princess Anne, but the movie feels numb, especially after ""Fashion Witch"" has set the bar so high for professional women and young people, it's also too warm and mediocre.。。"
"The bad thing about acting with the bones of the play is that it is not good enough, and the play is eaten up by the other party."
Anne Hathaway looks great on you.
"Freshly held laughter details: tapping words, massage will be hard, thunder snoring…With a lifetime of experience in the old ginger, no matter how high the academic qualifications also need to get job recognition, to find the rare modern gentleman manners… Nancy Meyers can always take a good picture in the vulgar subject matter, favorite chick flick director."
"""Hopefully it's just a momentary misjudgment, not love...This joy is what she deserves"" Slow down and enjoy life in Tai Chi."
"The encounter between the angel of high emotional intelligence and the sweetheart of Brooklyn genius is all rubbed into the Japanese-style warm serenade.From homage, back-to-back to soundtracks, it's fought off the gloom of my 30-year-old crisis.Jules is the future, but Ben is the one who owns the world.That's the most beautiful thing in my life."
"From Hathaway's point of view, who doesn't want to be able to have an old man who has experienced hardships in life, the content of the guidance is actually shown at the beginning and end: Taijiquan - slow, slow, slow."
"Good observation and not humble, warm and courteous, advice and never cross the line, principled and interesting, rich experience and never show off, do things properly, Ben is nearly 70 years old as a model of my generation!This movie also saw De Niro's old age calm and intelligent side, it is really all-powerful play God!7。6"
"A year and a half of e-commerce!Women can run businesses and men can be domestic men.New people in the workplace are no longer synonymous with their early 20s, and they can still work as interns at the age of 70.It's a time when gender and age are downplayed.As long as you have a healthy body and a positive mind, anything is possible!A very warm film!Annie's clothes look great!"
De Niro was so warm that he felt his tenderness and nobility across the screen.
"It's cold, drink chicken soup, and the driver's fan disappears."
"More standard chicken flick, three views, humor, famous characters, the most important thing is to have it all."
"In any case, the development of chuck flick from love to not sacrificing career for family is a huge social progress!"
Robert De Niro is like Grandpa in Flying House!
"The novelty of the film lies in balance and balance.Seventy-year-olds face up to their own social status quo, do not rely on the old to sell the old, do not emphasize the past, but silently rely on their own experience to help each young person continue to achieve their own value.30-year-olds gradually learn to balance everything in life, not to run away from problems in marriage, and not to deliberately curb their inner desires.Both things are difficult.But never give up the enthusiasm to learn and the courage to start."
"Old School is not just retro, not old-fashioned, not hip-hop, it is just a part of people who insist on good things, traditional habits and ideas."
"Watched the episode on a plane from New York to San Francisco, featuring Brooklyn Bridge and Golden Gate Bridge!"
"Basically relying on De Niro to support the field, Hathaway won the award, in recent years there is another impressive role?It doesn't seem to be."
"At most, it's the version of the post-marriage magnification.Light truck, white lilies of the United States.Of course, it's a lot of fun or something."
"Don't learn from Robert.Dinillo, stand at the entrance of the alley and wait for me!"
"A cheesy yet comforting enjoyment。 Robert DeNiro just played a perfect silver daddy in every women and men's dream, no kidding。( I put women before men hope y'all see what I suggest here"
"Nancy Meyers hasn't made a movie in years, and she's been focusing on old people's social relationships for decades, and her up-to-date start-up/female entrepreneurial setting is much more interesting than before."
"A warm-hearted comedy, the modern costume of Anne can not be more beautiful, her performance with De Niro is the biggest attraction.The story is less fashionable than The Queen in Prada."
"Watching this movie, I feel like I have the most say, I'm doing the same thing as a woman, but I'm 10,000 times smaller than her!We have super-similarities, but we have more to learn from her.There were countless scenes in between that moved me to tears.I think I'm going to watch it again."
It's the best tribute to this movie.
"I woke up at 5 a.m. and watched this movie I've always wanted to see.Oh my God, the beginning of a great day."
"Watching this ""women in the workplace"" movie is like flipping through women's fashion magazines, flipping through pictures to teach you how to dress, read columns and drink feminist chicken soup.Life is too easy for them, playing Taijiquan can be balanced.But the casting is still good.Stay classic。"
"Too boring, a director shooting a love vacation shooting what workplace story, the whole story is trying to make a fuss in a flat life, so mediocre."
You look great in it!
"Go gentleman like an old man, go passionate like a goddess."
130 stars at the end!
"The urban version of the elderly and young girls, no matter what age group, people always need to please each other in order to run into each other."
"Simple and comfortable, lacking in depth, but making up for it in warmth.Robert was simply handsome; Hathaway was so pretty, her expression was so tight that the little girl who had been an assistant to the demon-headed woman became a strongwoman.P."
"S. This movie is a textbook-level dressing tutorial, Hathaway's light mature girl OL style, Robert's retro suit style, every set is pleasing to the eye."
So the happy marriage of a strong woman is unsolvable…...especially with the Water sign Scumman.
"It's a good way to get rid of cheating husbands, but unfortunately not many men have this kind of awareness."
I think it should be shown on Christmas Day.Buy a warm ginger coffee.I've seen all of Robert De Niro's grandpa movies.It's brain powder.I love the warm and bright images of New York comedy movies.. Unburdened circumstances..
"Warm, inspiring and humorous with a high degree of completion.I also like Anna's dress in the movie..Exemplary of working women in the Eastern United States"
"Clothing and interior design guidelines.The first half is more interesting, and after the relationship is harmonious, the stereotype gradually appears, especially the addition of the husband character, so that the entire film almost degenerates into a standardized bad film."
I thought the intern meant Robert...Anne Hathaway is too weak to hold such a strongwoman.
"A bowl full of chicken soup, I thought Robert De Niro and Hathaway were going to roll the sheets.。。。。"
"The textbook chicken film.Seriously, Hathaway, playing a feminist figure, the whole place is being taught by a daddy, is that really okay?"
"Three and a half stars, I watched this movie for Robert De Niro.This kind of American feminine inspirational film isn't really my thing.…"
"Very warm fairy tale wind.Two hours doesn't feel long.The background music has always been in a similar tone, a little monotonous.Princess Ann plays the boss is also an assistant feeling, drunk.Women's rights are a bit superficial.The Godfather is cute."
"I've had a lot of confusing moments over the years, and a few times I naturally thought of my dad, and then I found out that he just wanted me to go back to my hometown and work as a civil servant.Movies are movies, reality is reality.This kind of ""feminine"" color allows women to have sufficient lewd space of the subject matter, from the beginning of BJ has not gone out of fashion indeed."
"Even if you find the ultimate handsome guy, don't you end up on your own?！"
"Politically correct, interesting material selection, strong Cas.But the whole movie is full of embarrassment and helplessness.Apart from the weak tension in the mainline drama, the old man's boring personality, the loose narrative, the protagonist's lack of chemistry, and the fact that Holm is blind, the office they live in is too much like a model house/hotel.It's no use looking at it.Annie started the fashion show again, but the clothes didn't match too well."
"It's a little too good, but I'm done with this chicken soup."
"Over the years, the dress has changed from M65 to a high-end suit, but the walking posture has not changed at all!"
Drink chicken soup and I'll identify Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway brands.
"Easy and effortless comedy, De Niro grandfather super cute, Hathaway is also beautiful glittering, after watching the whole person feel very happy."
"Ahahahahahahahahaha, Ben told Jules to pay attention to the ""inner peace"" bridge when playing Taiji is a tribute to the Kung Fu Panda?"
I wanted four stars.
"It was a standard Hollywood movie, but it ended with Hathaway and Scumboy taking a point off."
Late life in Corleone 😂
"The content seems to be in line with the trend, but it's actually one of those movies that's basically out of touch with the times, and the screenwriter's total failure to create a conflict; it's just a hot pot of sugar water."
"It is happiness to cherish what you have now, because what you have now does not know when you will lose it.Do what you like, stick to your original self, and treat life with a tolerant heart!"
Walking on the edge of a strange feeling.
"The problem is both at De Niro's age.In many scenes with the company's young employees, he showed obvious fatigue and perfunctory.What's more, his performance style is not suitable for the appearance of external charm to show comedy touch.The script was imposing a charismatic aura of goodwill on him, making him quickly the focus of the company's attention, but the audience didn't really feel why it should be."
"Blinking acting, high-end, atmospheric.Why travel to create some ambiguous suspense, afraid of embarrassment I am nervous.It's good to feel the progress of society."
"Anne Hathaway, from assistant to boss, is still wearing that navy sweater."
"Rather than being more mediocre than expected, I'm completely off the mark.。。 You know what?"
"Looking at De Niro, I really think that when people get old, the whole character will change into a round."
"Life is also like playing Tai Chi, balancing in one move, between breathing.A warm little piece of life, suitable for Christmas Eve to heal the mood.Favorite is Ben and Austin in overtime night conversation, warm lights, Ben talked about this is 40 years ago used to work in the place, brick by tile and the paulownia trees in front of the window are so familiar, the tacit understanding between the two is quietly growing.Unfortunately, the film is too formal, and gentlemen must bring handkerchiefs when they go out."
"Anne Hathaway Robert De Niro Anne Hathaway Love grows up four and a half stars first.He has been translating the title of the film inexplicable, Hong Kong name won again.Old and strong old man with princess noble couple, give you a bowl of super positive energy heart chicken soup, but there is a funny, Zhong want your master to do the job is to steal, but only to not hurt the old mother's heart, kind movies have a good return.。。"
"Robert De Niro's EQ is so high that he can be used as a work textbook (how not to warn the boss, pay attention to the boss's real needs, handle relationships with colleagues, and do his job diligently, etc."
).。。
Almost 4 stars.
"People who admire this ""old habit"" have achieved something in the secondary industry in this style.The play is written too casually, the shelves are well built, and the meat inside is not enough porcelain.It is good to use the old service industry's strict and self-disciplined executives and the new service industry to break the dogma of female strongmen as the starting point for storytelling."
"Grandpa is so cute, he is really kind and doesn't know how to refuse others, leaving steps for others all the time, and he is good at discovering the joy of life."
"Great acting, general story."
"The closest non-religious relationship you can think of is to be buried with you after death.The visual hardware is beautiful, and the story is much better than I thought (thankfully not on the cheesy mother-daughter relationship).Sexism and retro-era feelings, one points out the bruises that have not been scratched in the era, one is involved in nostalgia sighs."
New York is beautiful.
"The old intern's idea for a standard chick movie adds warmth to the theme of female inspiration.Ben completely retains the spirit and merits of traditional industries and avoids the cost of moving from secondary to tertiary industries.It was nice and healing, and when Ben told his and his wife's story not long enough to fall completely.Once again, I have to lament that all stories are romantic as long as they are middle-class."
"The two stars are well chosen, thinking of another version of Queen in Prada."
"Much better looking than I thought, I thought it was another queen in prada, who knows completely upside down Anne Hathaway's every outfit is really too good looking!！！"
"The airplane movie, chicken soup content is as previewed, so most of my focus is on various interior design.Trance can also see Hathaway sitting at the door of Aunt May's office as a shadow of a small assistant, and this age De Niro has said nothing but look at the expression can become a life mentor."
"Unbreakable Truth: Every well-organized Hollywood assembly line piece, regardless of its quality, is an example of cultural analysis."
Young women are attracted and controlled by conservative old white men who turn away from contemporary men and rely on their help in their careers and families.Affirmatism always ends in a positive image and ends in a negative one.
"Forty years after ""The Kramers,"" Hollywood's right-wing stance and hypocritical morality have never changed."
"Packed as a grown-up fairy tale.Mainly to see the hostess change a set of beautiful clothes, drink the director poured chicken soup.And the film itself threw out the topic of work and family issues, there is a workplace entrepreneurship continuation problem, try to ask which one is taken seriously?"
"In the end, nothing was resolved at all.A thin film.The most regrettable thing is to find such a fresh old and young partner, but not able to dig up a deeper spark of interaction."
"Ever since I found out that director Nancy Meyers is also Hollywood's top interior designer, I've been staring hard at both the protagonist's house and the to die for office.The American style and the natural light of the windows are too comfortable to use....that movie, De Niro is pretty cute."
Hathaway's not doing very well.
"Taipei is thin, overall it is just a fashion show, the design can not stand the taste, the male character design is too weak."
"Robert De Niro is my super-loved actor, and Annie's youth in front of him just compounded the needs of the plot, and the success of the casting is self-evident.In addition, the workplace in Europe and the United States is very natural no matter how to shoot, such as the office to hang a bell, such as the office masseuse and so on.On the contrary, when Chinese films appear in the workplace, there is a mysterious temperament of ""you are fucking kidding me."
"""I don't know why.In short, Ron is worth four stars."
"Chicken soup movies under the guise of feminism, about the career and company should be the main line, independent female and screenwriter are not very perfunctory, female image is that I am busy and obsessive.At first, to find a CEO is too large to control, and finally the screenwriter himself forgot this ballast, only to become a family vs career tangled."
Pseudo-feminist movie masterpiece: Just find a more mature male mentor.
"Overtime night talking about Ben back to work in the original place, arranged by the space to the big paulownia, is very touching.As a new start-up office scene, only highlights the unattended desk, and the conference room used several times, there is no good sense of scene.The bridge section is very old, especially the four men stealing a computer section, which is a compromise to the contemporary ""comedy"".Robert De Niro performed well, but the characters were too warm."
I've been complaining all day about how much I need this bowl of positive energy chicken soup!
"70-year-old veteran handsome man helps Taobao young women shop manager start a warm inspirational story, American Internet entrepreneurship ruins your life, cultivating body and mind still rely on Chinese Qigong."
"Taking intern's salary to work twelve hours a day for the boss, but also to help the boss take the child to drive, is this not a disguised squeeze on cheap labor!"
Bored to explode.
"Hathaway's husband cheated as the biggest tension in the movie, but he resolved it by ""husband confesses and realizes""; and the real reason why Hathaway originally wanted to hire external management: VC pressure is invisible forgotten."
I thought the end point was how to integrate senior interns into the modern Internet workplace.
"As a result, it was how the female boss balanced her career and family, and finally her husband's repentance was unnecessary."
"""I'm sorry, but I'm talking to you today as an elder.I'm an intern, but I've seen too much.I need to tell you a little bit about my life experience."""
"It was a warm friendship, and there was a bullet curtain cut off: ""The God who goes down the mountain guides the people who go up the mountain."""
"Robert De Niro's charm is not diminished.It's really cool compared to a bunch of little brats!In the movie he said he had a 42-year-old marriage, 18-year-old and his wife in love, my mind automatically gave birth to the godfather he stood behind the curtain shooting scene, 18-year-old you met his wife as a gangster…...hahahahahahahahahaha"
"Ten years later, the little assistant grew up as a strong woman, and his eyes were not broadened, and the first half of the movie was very good, but the whole thing was too light, and the style of deleting emails was very abrupt."
"In the middle of the rules, Miao Da good old grandfather, fragrant and standard, the appearance of exquisite high cold inner fragile crisis, strong female strongman, the end of the strong points.This piece of children's right pants off look, scum man confesses to be forgiven bridge let loose know that must be sprayed into a dog.What does that say, wildfires burn, spring breeze again.When a turbulent heart sprang up the first time you pinch it, he will grow a second time, a third time, until it becomes Hulunbuir prairie, very cocky."
"Bright colors, eternal preaching, the elderly minutes to teach you this little woman to be human.Look and don't look the same."
"Commercial,but cute story。 The only thing that's upsetting is why the word ""feminine rights"" appears on the film's usual label."
"The plot is gentle, but the old drama bone acting is really comfortable.The greatest secret to not being afraid of old age is to allow time to give yourself valuable wealth, not just wrinkles and gray hair.It's also fortunate to have someone like that talk to you when you're lost."
Grandpa De Niro cooks a bowl of soul soup for you to drink
"When it's time to eat, just look around and spend a relaxing night without burning your brain, and of course, don't care if you keep looking at the other half the next day."
"It was a great movie to watch on the plane.Hathaway's fashion show, De Niro's gentlemanly demeanor is really charming ~"
"I want to see the story of an old intern, okay?I don't want to see the family and love stories of young and beautiful entrepreneurial executives.If you really want to tell such a story, please change ""Intern"" to ""Struggling Jules."""
You are never wrong to do the right thing!
"I've seen it twice in a short time!Whenever attention ran into difficulties, I thought of Annie, who used to be a witch wearing Prada, and now she's the Intern.Like a distant idol, as she gets better, you walk better, glad."
It's boring.
The internship: 5.The most interesting part of the whole movie is the blue frog.
The Queen of Prada II.
"The subject matter is really brilliant, point to point, the ending is a little less flavor"
"Gentlemanly workplace light comedy, young and old posts caused by misplaced laughter.Relaxed chicken movies, pleasant adult fairy tales.Ten years later, Hathaway went from being Prada's little assistant to the queen, and De Niro was becoming more and more like Woody Allen."
I saw the beginning on the plane....have the opportunity to continue watching.
"Nancy Meyers' script and directing made the film very fluid!From the beginning, the story moves forward at a very comfortable and cheerful pace, which is a bit of a ""silk-like soft"" feeling, which most Chinese comedies or romantic films can't do!The two main characters are good, especially Hathaway looks beautiful and fashionable.The overall standard of the film is rather average, lacking a clear theme, and the second half of the film has collapsed a lot, far inferior to ""The Devil Wears Prada""."
"To see De Niro and Anne come, the process looks comfortable.The plot is general, why not strengthen the old point, whether from the comedy play or the sublimation of the theme, there is a lot of room."
"The whole world is pink film said that women's rights are funny, it is the general chicken flick ah, but De Niro is really too cute ~"
"The first half of the plot is very interesting, and the discussion about the definition of men is also very good, which is a little too flattering to women, and it is slightly distorted and unprincipled around the female protagonist."
"Although it entered too slowly for commercial films, the emotional agitation of the latter half was very effective due to the fullness of the characters.Effective, present-day feminist values.嗯，just stop blaming yourself for someone else's fault。"
I can't imagine the young man in Taxi Driver getting old.I didn't expect to find an answer in this movie that I've been confused about for a long time.
Plain as water.
The budget must have gone to the end of the movie.
Parents and the CEO of the recruitment didn't even have a shadow.
"However, it is not a story of interesting events between a post-80s boss and a post-40s intern"
Grandpa is really perfect.
"A medium-sized piece of female chicken.Yes, chicken fillets are now the world of women's girder.This movie raises the standard of warm men to old age at once!It's not my uncle's turn, it's my uncle's turn.…De Niro's acting is really natural, even after the shadow Hathaway is seconds ~[Eyes]"
"De Niro's appearance in this film is a Hollywood tragedy.It was a good movie star who played Taxi Driver, Good Fellas, and it was also heartbreaking to squeeze his eyebrows in such a spat film.Hollywood Reporter wrote an article that also indirectly questioned De Niro's personal wealth deficit to the extent that he needed to play Bad Grandpa, the Intern, which is not a movie."
Why is De Niro acting so tacky?I hate Anne Hathaway.
She's a princess diary.
"De Niro died handsome, this is called the gentleman, this is called the elegant man!The plot doesn't talk, especially at the end, let Hathaway dump the cheating old recognized De Niro as godfather!"
"The subconscious mind of a traditional patriarchal audience will never allow a successful and powerful woman to end well on screen, and the audience will only want to expel her in the name of patriarchy or sanction her (bankruptcy, failure, infidelity, etc."
").But postmodern patriarchy hides itself in a more hidden way: they pretend to give a strongwoman a good ending, but only if she is gazed at by a male character who is in control of the whole situation—the ""Ben,"" a symbol of patriarchal authority and status.When the super-powerful woman played by Seaway in the movie shows a fragile side in front of Ben, the audience who identify themselves as Ben has an orgasm in their skull, and at the same time emits a strong stench…"
Neymar I also want to have this kind of forgetful friendship in the cause has been moist and silent to show me the way!
I planted a sleeping gown.
"In general, Anne Hathaway was beaten back to her original form."
"It's great to be an adult gentleman like De Niro!Anne Hathaway, isn't she flat-chested?！！"
Brooklyn is too clean....the second half is all about catching horses.
"An old man, intelligent, gracious, not controlling, and even in love."
"Watched the taxi driver on Monday, watched this on Friday, and within a week he was 40 years older.But De Niro is still handsome!Smart Comedy has a good rhythm, it's very delicate and cute.I really appreciate De Niro's performance.The director is still very skilled."
I think this movie is weird...I always thought Anne Hathaway was going to roll the sheets with that 70-year-old uncle.I've been wondering why they're not getting out of here!
"Love the interior design, whether it is the living room kitchen or the office is particularly good, Hollywood directors are the best interior design!But I don't like the plot, pseudo-feminine.Ben is very attractive."
On the Position of Taijiquan in the Heart of the American Empire
Plain chicken soup.
"Lei Ren is the heroine of the paragraph about how good men used to be, how men nowadays don't grow big speech.I can't believe this kind of silly forked talk would come out of Anne Hathaway's mouth.Once upon a time there was Jack Nicholson and now there is Ezra Miller.In addition, there are many men who are racists and sexists in the past, so why glorify men who are likely to be the same as gay men who hate and discriminate against their wives as exercise?Yes, just because they fit more gender stereotypes."
The thought of such a lovely old man Luo going to play the dirty old man in the dirty grandfather was all over the place.
"The bed scene at the end was really embarrassing and almost brought the plot to a bad end.There is absolutely no need to create this embarrassing illusion.The whole article is still a reflection of the work place, and it is worth seeing."
"I don't know if it's because of Anne's relationship, I always think of the Queen wearing Prada_(: з」)_year-old daughter-in-law staying up as a mother-in-law."
"It's hard to be a strong woman, but why not be a strong woman?"
"If it were me who couldn't accept cheating husbands, there'd be no sand in my eyes."
"Fairy tales don't count, it's brainwashing at all, and the United States really wants to send those retirees back to work, and this kind of trick is used.Everyone in there was pretending to be wearing a thick mask of pig skin.But the masks are so beautifully carved that it's hard to notice the grease and abnormalities behind them for a moment."
"The genre determines that it must be avoided on the lighter side, is to tell you that life if not complete and noble and sub-complete appearance.But at least one thing is true, there are many things that can't be exchanged."
"This is not a 60-year-old senior intern, this is clearly a gentleman vice president with 40 years of business experience."
"What is this, adult Disney?"
It's unreal.
Annie's clothes are all very pretty.
Grandpa is very cute.Values are shit.
"Basically, you can think of Robert De Niro as the director himself, she wants to prove that the old man is doing something, you play with your special effects, our old experience is still classic.Renee Russell is old too, and I grew up watching her movies.。"
Experience is a curriculum vitae that never goes out of fashion.
"Boring time, ending with one star less."
"Nine years later, Anne is still beautiful.The male protagonist is really Mary Sue-like people set ah, people see love, flowers bloom, first step to capture the hearts of all the supporting actors, including the hearts of competitors, and then capture the hearts of boss, even boss daughter…OMG, isn't that the boss fell in love with me?"
Dig in the heart.
Dig in the shit.
"De Niro is very warm, too perfect, I Ed Niro, Anne Hathaway by comparison is so miserable.。。"
Gentlemen are charming all the time.
I've been looking at all kinds of clothes with WW's last outfit.
Robert Downey Jr.'s dad is older and more handsome than he really is
"Inexplicable script did a protagonist's out of focus, the trainee suddenly turned into a psychiatrist, although the two main characters are very realistic and cute, but I still don't understand why I should watch a movie where they finally practice yoga together."
"Why does the hostess feel that no one is buried together after the divorce, she is Tong Liya?"
Her own father will not let her bury back to her mother's house?
"Grandpa as an intern is very new, he actually gave the female boss a lot of spiritual guidance and courage, life experience is his treasure.But in the end, the female boss forgives the cheating husband, which is not very comfortable in the heart."
Love of the shopkeeper.
This is surprisingly heartwarming and fun。 Inspired。
"2016。3。15.946 Just ready to travel before the release of the movie has no time to go to the cinema to see, there is no work recently, thinking that watching a called intern may be helpful.Very comfortable light comedy with no absurd plot, only solid narratives and normal characters.Not much to look forward to, but a lot to gain."
"Another way of returning is to teach young people how to work and live as a gentleman, but also to be taught by young people how to adapt to modern society, but!What do you think is wrong?Give me a nice old vice president after retirement to advise me on my job at the price of an intern and give me a personal babysitter!"
"Warm movies such as ""Love at First Sight"", ""When Harry Met Sally"", ""Go and Leave"", ""Danny Collins"", ""A Little Faith"" I gave 3 stars, 3 stars together with ""road movies"", feel that these two types of movies are suitable for leisure and relaxation.So I've rated so many movies that I've concluded that my own rating of 4 stars or more is that there has to be some depth."
"Forgotten New Year's friendship is really in addition to family, love outside the most touching friendship, the standard of women to chicken soup, full of warm feelings.Uncle De Niro's people deeply interpreted what is a gentleman's character, with connotations and cultivation and grace; Anne successfully evolved from a work girl to wear Prada Miranda, family business is difficult.The director's filming style is very much to my appetite, idealized story even if I see it ten thousand times again, ah!"
"This expounds his old profession when the most emotional ~ window position, 40 years to do the same job…Do what's right because it's never wrong."
Is there a lack of comedy in my life?Everything in my country is missing the main theme.
"Two hours of screenwriting is not enough time to see, even the final capture of adultery and divorce have saved the dog blood."
Grandpa's idea would be perfect.
"Although the plot is not particularly old-fashioned, but the whole movie gives a sense of - good old-fashioned ah!Although I can't say the follow-up plot to come, but after watching it, I will think: this kind of drama is indeed this kind of plot trend and line matching ah."
"So whether it can be defined as college entrance examination composition, intermediate level composition is different, but still can recognize at a glance that this is a college entrance examination composition, too template."
"It is a film that promotes equality between men and women, the quality is actually good, the early stage can give a 7 or even 8 points.But forgiveness at the end is too easy."
"""Maybe I'm the kind of woman who compromises right away, but I still can't accept it — especially in this kind of film that promotes equality between men and women."
"Warmth and humor are important, seemingly bland but structurally rigorous, and can actually dive down."
"The ending is not very good, but surprisingly I like the story of the entrepreneurial woman leader and the elderly intern."
"Variant of Princess Knight Mode.Unbreakable tackiness is not a big problem, the most serious thing is that neither narrative nor kernel work.BTW, did the American people start saying goodbye in Japanese?"
"Three and a half stars, the first half was warm and solid, but the last half-hour was so confusing."
"The company has an old one, like a big one.Good old people experience sedimentation over the years and know how to say and do.Instead of scrambling for seats, going viral for something.Women deserve to be cheated on and single for the rest of their lives.The ending is perfect!！！"
Marrying Anne Hathaway can cheat.
God's forgiveness of sins is too easy.
"Anne Hathaway is beautiful!Of course Robert De Niro is handsome too!More importantly, the story of love and life is very well told, I like it!"
"""It's Never Wrong to Do the Right Thing。"" Elbow recommended the movie, too much like him."
"The male protagonist is too perfect, the first time to feel the charm of the elderly, completely match the word decent.I suddenly realized that it was a feminist color movie, and the intention was very good, but the ending was a little hasty and simple."
【Mature /s/1qYCJ2hA code wrg9 小
Love this old man!！

Anne went from being an intern at Prada to being a big boss and dressed really well (probably the only time I liked her).Old Robert has a lot of virtue and a lot of love.
"I love it, I love the old man, and I love the old man.I love the old man and want to be like him.No matter how, clean up your own clean, 70-year-old can also meet the heart of the object, but only if you can do it yourself.You have to be like yourself, only when you meet the person you like, do not be afraid to fight for, meet a.Yes, the most impressive thing about this movie is the love of old age."

"One star is for the actor's acting and personality, very charming personality.Spit out a mess without the center of gravity of the plot, and Anne Hathaway can only frown and mouth of the acting, it is annoying to see."

"Every time I watch this movie, I'm encouraged that 70-year-olds are so motivated to live that they can't be left behind."
Respect for the elderly and the wise should be used for this kind of old man.
That kind of hard-boiled philanthropist is just old man.
"It's really a classic movie, I've seen it before, and it's very inspiring to see it all."

It feels like a father is an assistant to his daughter.

DINILO: I used to be a godfather.
Don't mess with me.

"I went to the cinema when this movie was released, I was 19 years old, and after watching it, I thought that Jules was too stupid Matt was a scum man ah, cheating was 100% to break up at that time, I had not talked about serious love."
"It's almost 24 years now, and now I'm almost three years old, and I'm just beginning to realize that I didn't really understand what I was saying."
"Fortunately, my partner hasn't cheated, but I'm not the one who broke up when I feel cheated."

"Michelle Currier, there are international and intercontinental conglomerates that love to hire the kind of people you mentioned...
And then they'll insure these employees for high insurance premiums with the company itself as the beneficiary, allegedly murdering them to extract the high insurance claims."
It's all about designing a heavy workload and stress.
"to victimize and kill the good, hard-working, hard-working local bumpkin employees."
"in order to earn high claims from the insurance company, avoiding the requirement to pay taxes to the local government on general profits."
To quickly maximize the growth of the local business unit's benefits.
The profits are then paid back to the head office as spoils of war captured by overseas subsidiaries.
"McDonald's, Wal-Mart, ABN AMRO, one of the royal treasuries of the Netherlands..."
"They all have insurance companies to design, manufacture and purchase these types of controversies,
""moral defects, and murderous policies."
It seems that Home Depot also insures their employees against falls or hot oil burns at work.
There's no way for them to get a claim from this kind of policy.
Because.
The beneficiary is the company.
The policy states that an injury to an employee will affect the company's daily operations and profitability.
So the insurance company has to pay a high claim to the company that is suspected of oppressing the workers.
"So the insurance company must pay a high claim to the company that is suspected of oppressing the laborers, in order to compensate the company's loss ~ the life and death of the employees are not considered ~@_@

This type of policy encourages the heads of these multinational corporations and multinational consortiums to take a shortcut to the bonuses."
"When the lack of compensation and high work pressure can injure, maim and kill more and more local employees, the unscrupulous corporations will get the money from the insurance companies."
"The more insurance claims the unscrupulous corporation can extract from the insurance company, the more the organization's profitability will increase."
"The more money they can extract from insurance companies in the form of insurance claims, the higher the profitability of the organization will be."
It's a blood sacrifice of the lives of local employees in exchange for monetary compensation.
A contract of blood sacrifice.

"It's all my husband's fault, and life is for two people to run together."
"And hiring one or two managers after the company's scale expansion is a normal operation, on the one hand, can put the startup on the right track, on the other hand, can reduce the pressure on the founder, how the best of both worlds becomes as if bullying."
"And she, as the head of a start-up company, did not have the right to vote after taking a round of financing?"
